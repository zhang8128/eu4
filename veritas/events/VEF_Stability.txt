# VeF 2.0 Stability Mechanic
#
# vef_stability.1 : National Matineance routine
# vef_stability.2 : Stability Increase
# vef_stability.3 : Stability Decrease
#
# Province stability goes from -100 to +100, but will trend towards -50 and +50 with no intervention
# 
# -51 to -100......Highly Unstable
#  -1 to -50.......Unstable
#   0 to 49........Quiet
#  50 to 100.......Stable
#
# National stability ranges from -500 to +500. When hitting either boundary, causes a +1 or -1
# stability change. These values are modified by stability cost modifiers.
#
# Province Stability defaults to 0 at game start - that makes each province "Quiet"
#
# No event should directly increase/decrease stability (i.e. add_stability = N) more than 1.
# Generally, 'national_stability' should be changed by +/-250*N with a cap of 500. For an
# event that would change stability by -3, then, the following would be used:
#
# 			change_variable = { which = "national_stability" value = -500 }
# 			add_stability = -1
#
# This would potentially cause a reduction in stability overall of -2, but take into account
# the current status - that is, if they had several hundred points of stability gain then it
# would attenuate the loss. 
#
# Hitting province stability severely is actually a much harsher punishment in the long run.
