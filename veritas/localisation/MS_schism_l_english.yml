 EVTNAME100001: "Orthodox Victory"
 EVTDESC100001: "The last of our $RELIGION$ clergy have been routed from our provinces in the wake of the restoration of the Pentarchy and the end of the Great Schism. The situation is already bad, and it will only get worse if we attempt to take a stand."

 EVTNAME100005: "Legitimacy Issues"
 EVTDESC100005: "After the destruction of the Papal see, the legitimacy of the Catholic church has been in steady decline. The monarch's continued support of the institution is most certainly causing problems justifying his divine right to rule."

 EVTNAME100009: "The Eighth Ecumenical Council"
 EVTDESC100009: "It is only months after the dissolution of the Papacy, and the head clergy of our nation is already in disarray, struggling to control rampant heresy and Orthodox expeditions.

The local authorities in several provinces have already been raided, and Orthodox preachers, from within and without, are encouraging conversion and resistance. Disaster is looming, and there seems to be no alternative.."
 EVTOPTA100009: "Call the Eighth Ecumenical Council!"
 cardinals_title: "Side with the Clergy"
 cardinals_desc: "The debates have been progressing for some time, and it seems that a conclusion is in sight.

 EVTOPTA100017: "To arms!"
 EVTNAME100019: "Christian Confusion"
 EVTDESC100019: "It would appear that the Christian infidels cannot even make their mind up as to who to follow. In fact, one of their provinces has just switched from being 'Catholic' to being 'Orthodox'. Pathetic."
