 desc_cologne_golden_chamber: "The Golden Chamber, or Goldene Kammer, of the church contains the alleged remains of St. Ursula and her 11,000 virgins who were said to have been killed by the Huns, possibly around the time of the Battle of the Catalaunian Plains. The original legend stated that only 11 virgins accompanied St. Ursula but the number grew over time, eventually to 11,000. The walls of the Golden Chamber are covered in bones arranged in designs and/or letters along with relic skulls. The exact number of people whose remains are in the Golden Chamber remains ambiguous but the number of skulls in the reliquary is greater than 11 and less than 11,000. These remains were found in 1155 in a mass grave and were assumed to be those of the legend of St. Ursula and the 11,000 virgins. Therefore, the church constructed the Golden Chamber to house the bones. The bones themselves are neatly arranged in zigzags and swirls and even in the shapes of Latin words."

 cologne_cathedral.EVTDESC1: "For too long our proud and beautiful city has suffered the ruinous building site of the great cathedral. It is time to finish what our ancestors have begun. Two great towers shall rise up to the heavens to praise our lord with the strongest and biggest bells any men has ever seen. We shall give the magnificent shrine of the three kings a worthy cathedral to stand in and our glorious city a landmark for eternity. All our neighbours shall envy us and the bishop we've driven out of our city shall never set foot inside this greatest of all cathedrals. Our masterful architect has conducted a five stage plan and we finally are ready to start the first phase of the process."
 cologne_cathedral.EVTOPTA1: "I can't wait until it's finished."
 cologne_cathedral.EVTNAME2: "First Phase finished"
 cologne_cathedral.EVTDESC2: "The construction has been going well and we are entering the second phase of the plan. New scaffolds have been erected, old stones grinded by wind and rain over the years have been replaced and slowly but steadily the cathedral is growing taller. We are ready to continue with the procedure."

 cologne_cathedral.EVTNAME3: "Second Phase finished"
 cologne_cathedral.EVTDESC3: "The construction has been going well and we are entering the third phase of the plan. The walls have grown tall and both the nave and the nave aisles have been finished. The crypts have been widened and the choir erected. We are ready to continue with the procedure."
 cologne_cathedral.EVTNAME4: "Third Phase finished"
 cologne_cathedral.EVTDESC4: "The construction has been going well and we are entering the fourth phase of the plan. The construction of the roof has taken it's time but now it spans over everything we've build thus far and keeps the cathedral dry. Supported by huge pillars it shall withstand everything bad coming from above. We are ready to continue with the procedure."
 cologne_cathedral.EVTNAME5: "Fourth Phase finished"

 cologne_cathedral.EVTNAME8: "Construction delayed"
 cologne_cathedral.EVTDESC8: "Unfortunately our calculations were not as exact as we hoped they would be. Everything is taking longer than we thought and we need a lot more men and material than we've estimated, which results in higher cost for this project. Worst of all, if we won't pay for this delay, it might lead to a complete stop on the building site."

 cologne_cathedral.EVTNAME9: "Construction stopped"

As the new controller of the city we need  to decide what to do with it. The workers have fled as well as the architect who has taken the plans with him, but  with a little money they might just turn up again."

 cologne_cathedral.EVTDESC13: "For years now we've been searching for an architect to lead the construction of our cathedral and word has been sent to many cities, promising a good sum of money for the one we would hire. Now a foreigner called Master Ambrosius has come to our gates and offered his services."

 cologne_cathedral.EVTNAME14: "Treacherous Architect"
 cologne_cathedral.EVTDESC14: "A man arrived at our gates today, coming from Cologne and claiming to be our best friend. As it turns out our spymaster had hired him with out our knowledge and sent him to sabotage the construction of the city's cathedral. He not only managed to steal the plans but also brought home some of the money put into the project in advance."

 cologne_cathedral.EVTNAME15: "Fugger sponsorship?"
 cologne_cathedral.EVTDESC15: "The Fugger family in Augsburg is not only one of richest families in the Holy Roman Empire but also a very pious one. Considering the immense financial effort needed for this project we may consider asking them for sponsorship, bringing glory to their family name and our holy church."
 cologne_cathedral.EVTOPTA15: "Let's ask for sponsorship"

 cologne_cathedral.EVTDESC19: "Today a mysterious accident happened on our building site. One of our architects most trusted students fell of the scaffold to his death though it was a dry and windless day and there was nothing up there he could have tripped over. Soon whispers made the round, supposing several reasons for this."

 cologne_cathedral.EVTOPTC19: "Only an accident, nothing more, nothing less"
 cologne_cathedral.EVTNAME20: "Bells, Organs and other expensive Interior"
 cologne_cathedral.EVTDESC20: "To build a church is not enough, you need to equip it as well and we've been asked to pay for some of the more expensive interior."
 cologne_cathedral.EVTOPTA20: "We will pay all bells and an organ"
 cologne_cathedral.EVTOPTB20: "We will pay the bells, but not the organ"
 cologne_cathedral.EVTOPTC20: "We can't afford that, maybe you should ask the Fugger"
 cologne_cathedral.EVTNAME21: "Brilliant Organist"
 cologne_cathedral.EVTDESC21: "The Organ we bought for our cathedral is one of the finest in Europe and of course we are proud of the men using it. One of this men has proven himself to be exceptional gifted not only playing on it but also composing his own music."

 cologne_cathedral.EVTOPTB21: "We will make good use of him here in the city"

 cologne_city.EVTNAME0: "The City of Cologne"
 cologne_city.EVTDESC0: "The City of Cologne was founded by the Romans in 50 AD. In 313 the Bishopric was established. Ever since Cologne was an important center of trade and religion. During the Middle Ages it was the biggest city in the Holy Roman Empire and as a part of the once mighty Hansa, merchants of Cologne travelled to England and beyond. The proud citizens of Cologne struggled with the bishop for contol over the city for many years. In 1288 the Battle of Worringen took place by which, among other things, this struggle was decided in favour of the citizens. Ever since the bishop resided in Bonn and the city was in fact though not in law ruled by them. Take control of this proud and old city and lead it to a glorious future. Expend your trade and keep the bishop at bay. Take your place as a city as holy as Rome itself and maybe you will be able to complete the mighty cathedral that stands unfinished at the center of the city. Or you find your own way, it's up to you."
 cologne_city.EVTOPTA0: "Et kütt wie et kütt. (Let it happen as it happens)"
 cologne_city.EVTNAME1: "The Lochner Altar"
 cologne_city.EVTDESC1: "Stephan Lochner was a famous painter from Cologne. In 1446 he finished his most famous work, a Triptych depicting Mary, the Three Kings, St.Ursula and St.Gereon. It was kept in the chapel St.Mary in Jerusalem, the chapel of the City Hall. In 1810 it was transferred to the Cathedral. Showing all the patrons of the city you could call this great work a national epic of paint for the city."
 cologne_city.EVTOPTA1: "Well done I say"
 cologne_city.EVTOPTB1: "We should really build this cathedral"
 cologne_city.EVTNAME2: "The Gürzenich"
 cologne_city.EVTDESC2: "Between 1441 and 1447 the 'Gürzenichٰ' was build in Cologne. It was designed as great hall for festivities and assemblies and later even Imperial Diets. The architect for this great building was a local called Johann von Bueren."
 cologne_city.EVTOPTA2: "Support him with everything he needs"
 cologne_city.EVTOPTB2: "Let him build this 'Gürzenich'"
 cologne_city.EVTOPTC2: "Maybe he should help with the cathedral instead"
 cologne_city.EVTNAME3: "Request for Imperial City status"
 cologne_city.EVTDESC3: "Today envoys from the City of Cologne arrived at court and brought forth a request for our protection and the official status as a Free Imperial City. They also brought a generous gift with them to win our favour. If we grant them their wish it would strengthen our authority and show our great generosity. However, the Arch-Bishop of Cologne, one of our Electors, will be displeased with this decision, as he sees himself as the lawful ruler of the city."
 cologne_city.EVTOPTA3: "Of course we will grant them our protection"
 cologne_city.EVTOPTB3: "I wouldn't upset the Arch-Bishop, but thanks for the money"
 cologne_city.EVTNAME4: "The Free Imperial of Cologne"
 cologne_city.EVTDESC4: "In $YEAR$ Cologne was declared a Free Imperial City by $EMPERORNAME$. This put the City under imperial protection, a major setback for the Arch-Bishop. This was seen as a major achievement of $MONARCH$."
 cologne_city.EVTOPTA4: "A great day for the City"
 cologne_city.EVTOPTB4: "Outrageous!"
 cologne_city.EVTNAME5: "Request declined"
 cologne_city.EVTDESC5: "The Emperor declined a request for his protection by the City of Cologne. The rule over the City lies still in the hands of the citizens, but it is not legitimized by the status of a Free Imperial City. This strengthened the Arch-Bishops claim to be the lawful ruler of the City. The generous gift the envoys brought was taken none the less."
 cologne_city.EVTOPTA5: "You Bastard"
 cologne_city.EVTOPTB5: "A wise decision"
 cologne_city.EVTNAME6: "Homosexuals in the Government?!"
 cologne_city.EVTDESC6: "On his death bed one member of our city council declared that homosexual practices are widespread in our city, maybe even in the government itself. With this scandal on the rise a commission started to look into this matter and found the shocking truth. More than 200 of our most respected citizens are involved in this"
 cologne_city.EVTOPTA6: "Make this public knowledge and clean up our government"
 cologne_city.EVTOPTB6: "My own nephew? We should maybe stop looking into this"
 cologne_city.EVTNAME7: "The 'Transfixbrief'"
 cologne_city.EVTDESC7: "After the 'Verbundbrief' was signed the artisans could take part in the government of the city. But de facto only the rich artisans could execute their rights. Now large parts of our citizens claim, that their rights should be renewed in a new covenant, the 'Transfixbrief'. If we sign our government would be flooded by incompetent stone masons and butchers, but if we decline there might be a great uprising at hand."
 cologne_city.EVTOPTA7: "We could be persuaded to decline..."
 cologne_city.EVTOPTB7: "We shouldn't risk a rebellion"
 cologne_city.EVTNAME8: "The Societas Jesu in Cologne"
 cologne_city.EVTDESC8: "In 1618 the Jesuits build the church of St.Mariä Himmelfahrt in Cologne. Ever since they had a great influence on the city as scholars and priests, supporting the counter-reformation."
 cologne_city.EVTOPTA8: "For Cologne and the Pope!"
 cologne_city.EVTNAME9: "Jan von Werth"
 cologne_city.EVTDESC9: "Count John of Werth, called Jan von Werth, was a famous cavalry leader during the Thirty Years War. Born a son of a peasant he made a fast career in the army of the Bishopric of Cologne, fighting for the Catholic League. In Cologne he is still a local hero and there is a tale about him and a certain woman called Griet. When he was still a poor young soldier she wouldn't marry him, being a daughter of a wealthy and powerful family. But when he returned years later as a general and the savior of the city, he found her near the city gates selling apples. But enough with the fairy tale time, what to do with this promising young man enlisting in our army?"
 cologne_city.EVTOPTA9: "Let him win glory in the world"
 cologne_city.EVTOPTB9: "Take him on as an advisor"
 cologne_city.EVTOPTC9: "Let him lead our army"
 cologne_city.EVTNAME10: "The 'Goldene Kammer'(Golden Chamber)"
 cologne_city.EVTDESC10: "The Church of  St.Ursula contains some of the most important relique's of Cologne. If we were to build a richly decorated chamber - let's call it Golden Chamber -  to display these relique's, we could attract even more pilgrims and show our devoutness to the catholic faith."
 cologne_city.EVTOPTA10: "I like that name"
 cologne_city.EVTOPTB10: "It's too expensive"
 cologne_city.EVTNAME11: "Hätt jemand dä Schlüssel jesin? (Where is the key?)"
 cologne_city.EVTDESC11: "Since the Verbundbrief, rule over the city was divided between the artisan guilds called Gaffel. An important part of the rule was control over the treasury. To divide this control as well a special lock was made with 22 keys, one for each Gaffel, so they could only access the treasury together. Since we currently decided to hire some new guardsmen we have to access the treasury. As it turns out the Gaffel of the brewers has lost their key in a barrel of our finest beer and we can assume that it now lies in the cellar of a pub. So we now have to order a new, specially made lock. But the money for that is in the treasury. Which we can't open...."
 cologne_city.EVTOPTA11: "Damn those drunken fools. Somebody bring in a large hammer"
 cologne_city.EVTNAME12: "It happened again!"
 cologne_city.EVTDESC12: "You know the story: beer, key, money, treasury."
 cologne_city.EVTOPTA12: "If I didn't like their beer so much..."
 cologne_city.EVTNAME13: "Nikolaus Gülich"
 cologne_city.EVTDESC13: "In our glorious city everyone can make his own fortune and rise high in government. As long as he has the right family and friends. This system has kept the ruling families rich and the city calm. Everybody is content, because everybody has a cousin in some position or they know someone else. True citizens know how to work with this system and are contempt with it. But not so a certain council member called Nikolaus Gülich. He wants to reform the city's administration and get rid of what he calls nepotism and corruption."
 cologne_city.EVTOPTB13: "Appoint him as $MONARCHTITLE$"
 cologne_city.EVTOPTA13: "Get rid of him. As silent as possible"
