 venetian_arsenale.1.t: "The Venetian Arsenal - Setup"
 venetian_arsenale.1.d: "Hidden event. If you see this event, please report bug. Event ID: venetian_arsenale.1"
 venetian_arsenale.1.opta: "OK"
 venetian_arsenale.2.t: "Arsenal Damaged!"
 venetian_arsenale.2.d: "Horrible news from [Root.GetName]! In the chaos of occupation, some of these barbarians have entered the Arsenal, searching for prey - and laid fire! Halls, shipyards and armories were damaged."
 venetian_arsenale.2.opta: "A disaster!"
 venetian_arsenale.3.t: "Arsenal Reconquered"
 venetian_arsenale.3.d: "We regained control over the Arsenal. It is time to repair the damage..."
 venetian_arsenale.3.opta: "The Lion will rise again!"
 venetian_arsenale.4.t: "The Explosion of [GetYear]"
 venetian_arsenale.4.d: "A deafening detonation from the sestiere of Castello was even heard by the fishers of Chioggia this morning. The whole city panicked, and a sulphuric smell, like Dante described in his 'Inferno', suffocated Venice. The gunpowder warehouse of the Arsenal is no more; and the whole complex lies in ruins..."
 venetian_arsenale.5.t: "The Explosion of [GetYear]"
 venetian_arsenale.5.d: "A fiery explosion in the Arsenal's gunpowder warehouse in 1440 rocked the great shipyard and showered Venice with debris. After a second explosion in [GetYear], authorities have ordered that gunpowder be store on two remote island out in the lagoon. It won't happen again.\n\nHopefully."
 venetian_arsenale.6.t: "Fire in the Arsenal"
 venetian_arsenale.6.d: "Having a complex of foundries, gunpowder warehouses and armories side by side is not as safe as most people may think. Incidents may happen. Small incidents, sure. The Arsenalotti are prudent and experienced workers. They pay attention. Every single detail - like too much gunpowder in a certain angle, highly flammable chemistries or a false positioned cannon - is under their careful watch. Always. Well, mostly. Actually, even a good Arsenalotto can have a bad day.\n\nPlease, don't look out of that window! Only New Year's Eve preparations!"
 venetian_arsenale.7.t: "The Power of the Arsenal"
 venetian_arsenale.7.d: "The war against the archenemy of Christianity has motivated the Senate and the Arsenal to strengthen the [Root.GovernmentName] in our current war. The Arsenalotti have worked day and night to build some extra galleys for our campaign against the evil Turk - Viva Venezia!"
 venetian_arsenale.7.opta: "Viva San Marco!"
 venetian_arsenale.8.t: "Against the Infidels!"
 venetian_arsenale.8.d: "Our Arsenal is the biggest industrial complex in the world. It is time to check our new designs. With the bigger basins, we were able to produce some new warships in no time. Our new, ambitious admiral, Angelo Emo, will lead our fleet to glory. Let's show these Muslims our strength - Viva Venezia!"
 venetian_arsenale.9.t: "Angelo Emo's Reforms"
 venetian_arsenale.9.d: "Our admiral, Angelo Emo, has proposed some naval reforms after the last war. Emo wants to modernize the structure of the naval administration and introduce some successful tactics from other countries, which he learned in the course of the last war. Some say that it would better to make Emo an important advisor in naval matters, but others oppose his ambitions."
 venetian_arsenale.9.opta: "He should continue as an admiral"
 venetian_arsenale.9.optb: "He should become an advisor"
 emo_becomes_advisor: "Angelo Emo will stop being an Admiral."
 venetian_arsenale.9.optc: "He should reform the navy"
 venetian_arsenale.10.t: "The Corderie"
 venetian_arsenale.10.d: "The Corderie della Tana (Casa del canevo) were the manufactories of ropes in the Arsenal. With our new source of hemp, they will work better than ever. Some say that the quality of our ropes have an direct effect on the quality of our ships."
 venetian_arsenale.10.opta: "Our ships will fly over the sea, like a winged lion!"
 venetian_arsenale.11.t: "Antique Columns from Morea"
 venetian_arsenale.11.d: "After the conquest of the whole peninsula, our galleys have brought treasures from Greece. These pieces are a symbol of our latest triumph! Corinthian columns, old marble reliefs, giant lions of stone and many other fascinating things. The whole city welcomes our ships at the Bacino di San Marco. However, the Serenissima still hasn't decided what to do with these great relics..."
 venetian_arsenale.11.opta: "Arrange an exhibition"
 venetian_arsenale.11.optb: "We should use these to decorate the Arsenal"
 
 #Decisions
 arsenale_expansion_1_ven_title: "Expand the Arsenal (I)"
 arsenale_expansion_1_ven_desc: "The current Arsenal is a shame for Venice. It hasn't been in this state since 1225! We must counter the ruin of our beloved wharf, our naval soul, our heart of Venice. We have to build a new basin and encourage more Arsenalotti to revive the greatest industrial complex in the world! The first expansion will increase our current benefits, and lower our costs regarding ships."
 arsenale_expansion_1_all_title: "Expand the Arsenal (I)"
 arsenale_expansion_1_all_desc: "The current Arsenal is a shame. It hasn't been in this state since 1225! We must counter the ruin of our beloved wharf, our naval soul, the heart of Venice. We have to build a new basin and encourage more Arsenalotti to revive the greatest industrial complex in the world! The first expansion will increase our current benefits, and lower our costs regarding ships."
 arsenale_expansion_2_ven_title: "Expand the Arsenal (II)"
 arsenale_expansion_2_ven_desc: "Our Arsenal has only two basins at the moment, forming the Arsenale Vecchio and the Arsenale Nuovo. But that's not enough. We need a manufacture for our ropes, the Corderie, to better our efforts. Other workshops, including a manufacture of oars and deposits of tar, cables, rigging, wood, nails, anchors and chains will lead to a faster production. When done, the second expansion of the Arsenal will further increase our current benefits."
 venetian_arsenal_idea: "Have §YVenetian Arsenal§! idea"
 arsenale_expansion_2_all_title: "Expand the Arsenal (II)"
 arsenale_expansion_2_all_desc: "Our Arsenal has only two basins at the moment, forming the Arsenale Vecchio and the Arsenale Nuovo. But that's not enough. We need a manufacture for our ropes, the Corderie, to better our efforts. Other workshops, including a manufacture of oars and deposits of tar, cables, rigging, wood, nails, anchors and chains will lead to a faster production. When done, the second expansion of the Arsenal will further increase our current benefits."
 arsenale_expansion_3_title: "Expand the Arsenal (III)"
 arsenale_expansion_3_desc: "It's time to think in bigger dimensions when it comes to the Arsenal, our beloved wharf. Our plans foresee the construction of a new powderhouse (Casa della Polvere), a new foundry (Fonderie), two control towers at the main entrance and an enlargement of the walls. More room will give us more possibilities in the future. With this expansion, we won't only raise our current benefits to a new level, but also get an additional bonus to our local production efficiency."
 arsenale_expansion_4_title: "Expand the Arsenal (IV)"
 arsenale_expansion_4_desc: "Our naval soul, the Arsenal of Venice, needs a new expansion. Two new water sheds and workshops for arms and artillery are only two of our future projects. The main construction will be a new basin, called the Arsenale Nuovissimo. For that, Venice needs more goods from its dominions to support this development. With this great enlargement, costs for ships will fall significantly and shipbuilding becomes faster than ever."
 arsenale_expansion_5_title: "Expand the Arsenal (V)"
 arsenale_expansion_5_desc: "The Arsenal is an impressive complex, but we have to expand it even further! New channels between the basins, new docks, new resources and new workshops for artillery production are needed. To ensure the good work of our Arsenalotti, we need also free rations for our workers. The Arsenal will be more productive than ever."
 arsenale_expansion_6_title: "Expand the Arsenal (VI)"
 arsenale_expansion_6_desc: "The whole world is envious when it comes to the Queen of shipbuilding, the glorious Arsenal of Venice. Now is the time to modernize the whole complex for bigger ships. New types, like the 'Fregata Veneta' (venetian ship-of-the-line) needs more space than traditional ships. This will cost us money, resources and huge efforts, but after that, we will be able to build ships much faster and cheaper. Let's build the final expansion of the Arsenal - Viva San Marco!"
 
 #Buildings
 building_arsenale_base: "The Arsenal"
 desc_arsenale_base: "This version of the Arsenal has only the basic equipment and houses. We really should expand the Arsenal - what about a new basin?"
 building_arsenale_first: "The Arsenal"
 desc_arsenale_first: "With the new basin, we can accelerate the process of shipbuilding. Further expansion of the Arsenale will allow even more benefits."
 building_arsenale_second: "The Arsenal"
 desc_arsenale_second: "The Arsenal of Venice has an important value when it comes to our naval power. The current version gives some benefits, but a more advanced and expanded Arsenal would be better for our future plans."
 building_arsenale_third: "The Arsenal"
 desc_arsenale_third: "The Arsenal has grown in the last decades, and more and more Arsenalotti do their service in the different workshops. Manufactures of oars, deposits of tar and other naval supplies encourage the our dominance in the Adriatic Sea."
 building_arsenale_fourth: "The Arsenal"
 desc_arsenale_fourth: "This is a rather expanded version of the famous Arsenal of Venice, home of shipbuilding and naval matters. The high red walls surround a significant area of the city, forming a mysterious microcosm in the heart of the state."
 building_arsenale_fifth: "The Arsenal"
 desc_arsenale_fifth: "No workshop, no manufacture, no factory is a match for the venetian Arsenal, the biggest wharf in the world. The Arsenalotti are famous for their experience, their fast production and repair. There are halls filled with different components, which can be used to build a row of galleys in a couple of weeks."
 building_arsenale_sixth: "The Arsenal"
 desc_arsenale_sixth: "Quale nell'arzanà de' Viniziani \n bolle l'inverno la tenace pece \n a rimpalmare i legni lor non sani, \n ché navicar non ponno - in quella vece \n chi fa suo legno nuovo e chi ristoppa \n le coste a quel che più viaggi fece."
