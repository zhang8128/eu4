 PISAN_INSURRECTION_NAME: "The Pisan War"
 PISAN_INSURRECTION_DESC: "In the chaos of the First Italian War, Pisa was able to regain its independence after decades under Florentine rule. Florence, which suffered under the diplomatic and militaristic changes in Italy, was paralyzed for over a year. Pisa's walls proved to be strong, and the brave Pisans defended their new freedom with their bare hands and bones. The struggle continued for nearly 15 years, in which Pisa was supported by foreign powers like Venice and Milan. Nevertheless, the resources of Florence seem much vaster. Can Pisa preserve its newly achieved freedom?"
 PASQUE_VERONESI_NAME: "Pasque Veronesi"
 PASQUE_VERONESI_DESC: "In 1796, Napoleon conquered the Venetian provinces of Bergamo, Brescia and Verona. Venice did nothing against it, hoping to resolve the revolutionary conflict diplomatically, and declaring itself neutral in the War of the First Coalition. The Veronese, suffering under French occupation, rose up at Easter - the 'Pasque Veronesi' a large revolt of Veronese citizens, but also other cities in the region of Lake Garda, rose up in rebellion. Days later, Napoleon declared war upon Venice, announcing that he would be an 'Attila' for the Serenissima. Can the little republic of Saint Mark resist the mightiest army in the world?"
 SERENISSIMA_ITALIA_NAME: "Serenissima Italia"
 SERENISSIMA_ITALIA_DESC: "In the 15th century, Italy was dominated by five major powers which formed a pentarchy to keep each other in check and prevent every hegemony. Beside inter-Italian struggles, each of these states had internal affairs to solve. In Florence, the Medici dynasty tries to establish their rule by supporting the Renaissance and gaining the favor of the different social factions. Venice with its unique system tries to keep a balance in its government. Besides those powers, there are other interesting choices like Siena with its Palio, or the City of Cologne, which still dreams to finish the cathedral. Or maybe you want to relax? Play a game of Jeu de Paume, festivate the Carnival or or enjoy the Opera! By the way, shouldn't you modernize your out-fashioned capital a bit...?"

The Turks and the pirates were making dangerous inroads on the coast of the Tyrrhenian Sea. The Grand Duke needed a symbolic conflict to unite the nobility of the different cities that combined to form his new grand duchy (including Florence and Siena), and to demonstrate his support of the Roman Catholic Church. Finally, the creation of a Tuscan military order would also strengthen the prestige, both internal and international, of Cosimo's new state."

 finish_duomo_di_siena_title: "Il Duomo di Siena"
 finish_duomo_di_siena_desc: "The cathedral of Siena was originally designed and completed between 1215 and 1263 on the site of an earlier structure. It has the form of a Latin cross with a slightly projecting transept, a dome and a bell tower. The origins of the first structure are obscure and shrouded in legend. There was a 9th-century church with bishop's palace at the present location. In 1196 the cathedral masons' guild, the Opera di Santa Maria, was put in charge of the construction of a new cathedral. Works were started with the north-south transept and it was planned to add the main, larger body of the cathedral later, but this enlargement was never accomplished. By 1215 daily masses were already being said in the new church. A second massive addition of the main body of the cathedral was planned in 1339. It would have more than doubled the size of the structure by means of an entirely new nave and two aisles ranged perpendicular to the existing nave and centred on the high altar. The construction was begun under the direction of Giovanni di Agostino, better known as a sculptor. Construction was halted by the Black Death in 1348. Basic errors in the construction were already evident by then, however, and the work was never resumed. The outer walls remain of this extension, and can now be seen to the south of the Duomo - a sign of Sienese ambition, but also failure. The Duomo has become the symbol of the decline of our city. Should Siena never rise again?"

 organise_calcio_desc: "Calcio Fiorentino is an early form of football that originated in 15th century Italy. Although once widely played, the cradle of the sport is now considered to be the Piazza Santa Croce in Florence. Here it became known as the giuoco del calcio fiorentino ('Florentine kick game') or simply calcio; which is now also the name for football in the Italian language. The game may have started as a revival of the Roman sport of harpastum. Calcio was reserved for rich aristocrats who played every night between Epiphany and Lent. Even Popes, such as Clement VII, Leo XI and Urban VIII were known to play the sport in the Vatican City. The games were known to get violent as teams vied with each other to score goals. In 1574 Henry III of France attended a game of 'bridge fighting', put on in his honor during a visit to Venice; the king is recorded as saying: 'Too small to be a real war and too cruel to be a game'. It was also known as the favorite sport of many Italian Princes, who sought to exercise their bodies."

 organise_jeu_de_paume_title: "Organise a match of Jeu de Paume in $CAPITAL_CITY$"
 organise_jeu_de_paume_desc: "Jeu de paume (English: 'palm game') is a ball-and-court game that originated in France. It had some similarities with palla, fives, pelota, and handball, involving hitting a ball with a bare hand and later with a glove. One theory is that this game was played by monks in monastery cloisters, based on the construction and appearance of early courts, some of which were grass fields. By the 16th century, the glove had become a racquet, the game had moved to an enclosed playing area, and the rules had stabilized. Real tennis spread in popularity throughout royalty in Europe, reaching its peak in the 16th century. Francis I of France (1515–47) was an enthusiastic player and promoter of real tennis, building courts and encouraging play among courtiers and commoners. His successor Henry II (1547–59) was also an excellent player and continued the royal French tradition. In 1555 an Italian priest, Antonio Scaino da Salothe, wrote the first known book about tennis (Trattato del Giuco della Palla). Two French kings died from tennis-related episodes - Louis X of a severe chill after playing and Charles VIII after hitting his head during a game. King Charles IX granted a constitution to the Corporation of Tennis Professionals in 1571, creating the first pro tennis 'tour'. Royal interest in England began with Henry V (1413–22). Henry VIII (1509–47) made the biggest impact as a young monarch; playing the game with gusto at Hampton Court on a court he built in 1530. It is believed that his second wife Anne Boleyn was watching a game when she was arrested and that Henry was playing when news of her execution arrived. During the reign of James I (1603–25), London had 14 courts."

The works in it were compiled during a time span of around 40 years, from the mid-1470s until the beginning of the 16th century. The manuscript contains 458 works, the bulk of which are in Castilian, although a few works also appear in Latin, French, Catalan and Portuguese. It constitutes an anthology of the polyphonic music performed during the reign of the Catholic Monarchs. The themes found in the songs are the most varied: romantic, religious, festive, chivalrous, satirical, pastoral, burlesque, political, historical, etc., accompanied by music of all styles, from popular folk songs to elaborate compositions. The most important musical form is the villancico, though other genres are also found, such as the romance and the canción. The majority of the works are for one voice with instrumental accompaniment but polyphonic works are also available for two, three or four voices. Famous composers like Juan de Encina, Luis de Milán or Pedro de Escobar contributed pieces to this compilation. Some villancicos, like 'Rodrigo Martinez' are also mentioned in this fine example of Iberian high culture."

Traditionally during Lent, no parties or other celebrations were held, and people refrained from eating rich foods, such as meat, dairy, fats and sugar. While medieval pageants and festivals such as Corpus Christi were church-sanctioned celebrations, carnival was also a manifestation of medieval folk culture. Some of the best-known traditions, including carnival parades and masquerade ball masquerading, were first recorded in medieval Italy. The carnival of Venice was for a long time the most famous carnival. From Italy, it spread to other parts of Europe. Carnival traditions developed especially in central Europe, along the rivers Rhine and Main, with centers in Southern Germany, the Rhineland and Burgundy."

With the progress of diplomatic technology, every western country may build a hall and play the game."

 Serenissima_information: "Most Serene Republic of Saint Mark"
 desc_Serenissima_information: "This form of government consists of several institutions, forming a complicated web. The most important are the Maggior Consiglio (Great Council), the Consiglio dei Pregadi (Senate), the Consiglio dei X (Council of Ten) and the Doge (head of state). As long as they stay in harmony, the Venetian system will be beneficial for our country. The power of one institution is defined by power points, which determine the power-level of one institution. A weak institution has 0-14 points, an influential one has 15-29 points, a strong one 30-44 points, and a dominant one has more than 45 points. If the balance should be disturbed, the patricians will try to counter the menace. This especially applies for an ambitious Doge, who may seek to change the political landscape in his favour. Changes will take a long time, and will only occur during the day-to-day business of the state, as the competences of the different councils tend to overlap. Low republican tradition and an unbalanced system make such struggles more common."

 venetian_republic.EVTNAME0: "La Serenissima"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC0: "In 1297, with the so-called Serrata, the membership in the Great Council of Venice (Maggior Consiglio) became hereditary. The Maggior Consiglio was the basic institution of the Republic of Venice in which every patrician had a seat and could participate in political life. As it grew further (with around 2000 members in the 16th century), other institutions had to be elected by the members of the Maggior Consiglio to keep the Serenissima governable. At the end of the 14th century Venice had a vast amount of different councils, forming a net of complex institutions with overlapping competences: the Avogardori del comun, the Quarantia, the Consiglio dei Pregadi (Senate), the Collegio dei Savi, the Consiglio dei X (Council of Ten) and the Procuratori di San Marco are only some names to give an idea. The most important rule in this kind of government was the prevention of a monarchy. Powerful offices, like a seat in the Consiglio dei X, had only a short tenure and members couldn't be elected for successive terms. The Consiglio dei X became the most important office in the 14th century, as it was intended to preserve the government from overthrow. Unfortunately, councils with the ability to determine high treason tend to become overpowered authorities. In the 15th century, the 'Ten' were able to gain control in financial, military and judicial areas, becoming the strongest institution in Venice. The Senate, on the other side, consisted of members who stayed in office and tried to keep the Council of Ten in check, having lost some traditional competences to that organisation. Last but not least, there is still the Doge, the face of the Serenissima herself. Before the 11th century, he ruled Venice like a monarch, then becoming the 'first slave' of the Republic. It's not the first time that an institution changed its face, and it won't be the last time. Venice is an harmonic organism. Tipping the balance is possible... but the patricians will keep their republican ideals, making Venice an exceptional governmental body, not only in Italy, but in the whole world."

Then amid great rejoicing he went up to the palace, and on the stairs he stopped with the gonfalon in his hand, and the chaplains of St. Mark cried aloud: 'Let Christ conquer! Let Christ reign! Let Christ rule! And to our Lord $MONARCH$, by the grace of God, illustrious Doge of Venice, Dalmatia, and Croatia, and lord of the fourth part and a half of the Empire of Romania, be safety, honor, long life, and victory! May St. Mark be thine aid!' Then the Doge entered the palace, and the chaplains went to S.

 venetian_republic.EVTOPTB8: "The Consiglio dei X should have more control."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTC8: "You should trust these delicate matters to the Doge."
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME9: "Naval matters"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC9: "The Doge was the head of the venetian navy, the Armada. The Senate, which wanted to limit the competences of the Doge, tried to assign a new naval officer, without consulting the Doge, trying to replace the head of state."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA9: "They may assign this captain."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTB9: "The Doge is the captain-general of the sea!"

 venetian_republic.EVTNAME10: "Quarantia"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC10: "One of the most important offices regarding juridical matters was the Quarantia. It consisted of 40 men (quaranta), elected by the Maggior Consiglio. The president of the Quarantia (Capo) had considerable power. At the end of the 15th century, two new Quarantie were formed to deal with civilian law. It also controlled the Zecca, the minting press of the republic. This evolution was in the interest of the republican spirit and the division of power, but made the administrative process harder."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA10: "More power to the Quarantia."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTB10: "Keep the balance."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTC10: "More power to the Council of X."
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME11: "Avogardori del comun"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC11: "The Avogardori del comun were the attorney general of the republic. Even the Council of X feared their power. The Avogardori del comun preserved the republic from corruption, despotic ambitions, or irregularities in the councils. A member of the Senate who broke the rules was at risk of facing severe penalties. In fact, such a case arose at the court of $CAPITAL_CITY$ in $YEAR$."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA11: "The Avogardori should do their job."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTC11: "The Avogardori shouldn't intervene."
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME12: "Procuratori di San Marco"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC12: "One of the oldest offices in the republic is the office of a Procuratore. It is so old, that no one knows exactly what a Procurator has to do. Theories considering an active role in the maintenance of the Basilica di San Marco seem plausible, but don't explain why this role was one of the most prestigious in the Serenissima. Many Doges served as Procuratore before their election, and were highly esteemed. In fact, some say, that a Procuratore of Saint Mark doesn't even have a competence."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA12: "Procuratori do have a competence."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTC12: "Procuratori don't have a competence."
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME13: "Consiglieri del Doge"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC13: "Six Consiglieri had the duty to observe and control the Doge to prevent tyranny. A Doge couldn't have any discussions with an important person without at least two Consiglieri in the same room. He wasn't even allowed to open a letter without Consiglieri at his side. Together with the Doge, they formed the Signoria, the leading structure of the republic. This made the Consigliere one of the most important and powerful offices."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA13: "They should control the Doge."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTC13: "Even a Doge has some basic rights."
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME14: "Inquisitori"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC14: "Two of the ten members of the Consiglio dei X (and one of the Consiglieri del Doge) were known as the Inquisitors of the state. Historically, when Venice lost its power in the 17th century, the Inquisitori became more powerful, forming a council within the council. The Inquisitori had to prevent conspiracies against the state and had to deal with high treason. They were the most feared organisation in the republic, known as the three 'babì' - the three ghosts. To limit the power of the Ten, there are suggestions that the state inquisitors should be split off from them, creating an independent council."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA14: "Split the Inquisitori from the X."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTC14: "We must keep the Consiglio dei X strong."
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME15: "Cancelier grande"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC15: "The Cancelier grande (Grand Chancellor) is one of the most interesting offices in our government. Like the Doge, he is elected for life and is highly esteemed. Unlike all other offices, the Grand Chancellor is a citizen, not a patrician. His competences are limited, but he works closely with other offices and keeps order in the Maggior Consiglio."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA15: "The Cancelier grande does a good job."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTC15: "Limit his powers."
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME16: "Dogaressa"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC16: "The wife of the Doge was the Dogaressa. Beginning in the 16th century, the Dogaressa began to wear special clothing - emulating the style of the Doge - and played a role in feasts or celebrations. Some opposed that development, because 'Dogaressa' was only a position, not an office. Others wanted to give the republic a more prestigious face. The status of the Dogaressa remained a highly disputed topic."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA16: "That's against the republic!"
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTC16: "The Dogaressa has every right to do so."
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME17: "Collegio dei Savi"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC17: "Originally, the Collegio dei Savi (council of the wise men) was an institution for debating political matters in a circle of experts, formed by members of the Senate. Forming a collegio was a normal procedure in the Consiglio dei Pregadi, similar to a modern committee. Over the years, the Collegio dei Savi became autonomous and permanent, acting like a cabinet of the republic. It also prepared the sessions of the Maggior Consiglio. The Collegio assumed competences in military and foreign affairs, creating a conflict with the Consiglio dei Pregadi."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA17: "The Senate shouldn't intervene."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTC17: "The Senate may intervene."
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME18: "Signoria"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC18: "The Signoria consisted of the Consiglieri and the Doge, forming the highest representation of the Serenissima. On the death of a Doge, a common proverb was used, saying: 'The Doge is dead, but the Signoria is not'. In an attempt to limit the power of the Doge, the Maggior Consiglio tried to lessen the influence of the Signoria."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA18: "The Signoria is too strong."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTC18: "The Signoria should be stronger."
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME19: "Provveditori"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC19: "Many administrators of the city - or in the republic as a whole - were named 'Provveditori', a kind of minister controlling certain economic, financial or juridical areas. This decentralized structure divided power, underlining the republican ideal. On the other hand, central organisations like the Consiglio dei X or the Consiglio dei Pregadi sought to extend their competences."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA19: "We should strengthen the Provveditori."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTC19: "We should strengthen the councils."

 venetian_republic.EVTNAME20: "Denunciation in the Council of Ten"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC20: "The 'Ten' were the police in Venetian politics, dealing with denunciations and accusations of high treason. Ironically, a citizen has denounced a member of that very council in the last week. The Council of X seeks to protect their member, in an attempt to prevent a scandal. However, the reputation of the council is ruined, and other powers in the republic seek to profit from this disaster."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA20: "This behaviour is against the republic!"
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTB20: "We will handle this problem when their term is up ..."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTC20: "That's it, the Doge will intervene!"
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTD20: "There is nothing we can do."
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME21: "Homosexual in the Senate?"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC21: "A diplomatic mission, sent to the Consiglio dei Pregadi, ended in an unexpected manner. One of the Senators made 'unusual advances' regarding a member of the foreign delegation, resulting in an embarrassing diplomatic faux pas for our country. The Consiglio dei Pregadi tends to defend its member, fearing a loss of power for the whole institution, whereas other councils try to gain further control in the government."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA21: "Oh, the scandal!"
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTB21: "The Senate will find a solution. If not, others will..."
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME22: "Deadlock in the Maggior Consiglio"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC22: "The Maggior Consiglio is the beating heart, the sovereign, the most magnificent symbol of our republic. Unfortunately, it also consists of more than 1000 Venetian nobiluomini, which makes the state less governable. A current debate concerning trade policies ended in a struggle between different merchant groups with their own interests. As this discussion goes on, the Maggior Consiglio is blocked and not able to find a proper solution. Some countrymen suggest, that other councils should solve that problem. Naturally, those 'countrymen' are members of these councils and interested in gaining more power in the republic."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA22: "If the Great Council isn't capable, other councils should debate the matter."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTB22: "In the future, the Ten and the Senate should have a look..."
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME23: "The Son of the Doge"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC23: "Since the 11th century, the different councils were able to lessen the power of the Doge. One of those laws considers the status of the family. The members of the ruling dynasty aren't allowed to be members of any important political institution. Later, a son of the Doge wasn't even allowed to start a church career. In the case of daughters, marriages with foreign rulers were prohibited, too. When the son of $MONARCH$ was appointed as capo of the Quarantia, it was considered a scandal."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA23: "Right. They should re-elect."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTB23: "Other councils will gain competences in exchange."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTC23: "... and?"
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME24: "An influential family in the Council of Ten"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC24: "Nepotism was an abnormality in the venetian system. However, considering the strength of the Consiglio dei X and the decadence of republican values, it is no wonder that one family was able to achieve a strong position in our government. In fact, there are two brothers, sitting in the Council of Ten - a huge blow for our tradition. On the other hand, removing one or even two of them would have severe consequences, because the council leads our land with a strong hand."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA24: "Remove the brothers and start a tribunal!"
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTB24: "We will deal with them later."
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME25: "An influential family in the Senate"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC25: "Nepotism was an abnormality in the venetian system. However, considering the strength of the Consiglio dei Pregadi and the decadence of republican values, it is no wonder that one family was able to achieve a strong position in our government. In fact, there are a uncle and his nephews, sitting in the Senate, controlling the common opinion in this institution - a huge blow for our tradition. On the other hand, removing them would have severe consequences, because the council leads our land with a strong hand."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA25: "Remove the uncle and his nephews and start a tribunal!"
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME26: "An influential family in the Great Council"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC26: "Nepotism was an abnormality in the venetian system. However, considering the strength of the Maggior Consiglio and the decadence of republican values, it is no wonder that one family was able to achieve a strong position in our government. In fact, there are a group of cousins, sitting in the Great Council, controlling the common opinion. On the other hand, removing them would have severe consequences, because the council leads our land with a strong hand."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA26: "Remove the cousins and start a tribunal!"
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME27: "A gift to the Doge"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC27: "The Doge was accused of accepting a gift, an accusation which the Council of Ten and the Avogardori del comun examined. After an investigation, they found proof. The Doge is now in a delicate position as the promessioni - a collection of laws which the Doge has to confirm with an oath - forbid such an action."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA27: "Right. That would be against the republic."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTB27: "The other council will get competences in exchange."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTC27: "I like my new gold-ejaculating otter. Look at his shining smile!"
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME28: "Electoral fraud?"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC28: "It seems that one of the recent elections was overshadowed by manipulation, corruption and fraud. No one knows how that could have happened, as the election system of our land is one of the most advanced in the world. On the other hand, there are several powers who fear an investigation, for obvious reasons. There are accusations and suspicions everywhere, and the Senate blames the 'Ten' so that they may investigate in a direction, from which only the Consiglio dei X may have an advantage. In this dire situation, even the Maggior Consiglio wants to discuss the situation, suggesting that this problem can only be addressed by an open discussion."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA28: "The Council of Ten should investigate!"
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTB28: "The Senate should investigate!"
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTC28: "The Doge is sure that an investigation would be pointless."

 venetian_republic.EVTDESC29: "Our system seems to be in a perfect shape. No institution is overpowered, no one to weak. Each council keeps the other in check, and the offices never worked better. This harmony is very beneficial for our state, and the only question remains: who is responsible for this paradise on earth?"
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA29: "Thanks to the Maggior Consiglio and his noble members."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTB29: "Our Senate is an outstanding example of virtue."

 venetian_republic.EVTDESC31: "When $MONARCH$ appeared in the Signoria, it was clear that he wasn't able to keep the strong position of his predecessor. His abilities in state business and intrigue are too low to have an important role in the government. This Doge would be a marionette of the republic."
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME32: "In senatu senator, in foro civis, in habitu princeps"

 venetian_republic.EVTNAME34: "The iron fist of the republic"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC34: "The office of the Doge has accumulated an incredible power in the last years. Since the days of Vitale Michiel, a Doge of the middle of the 12th century, the head of the republic has not had such a leading role. This evolution has not gone unnoticed by the councils of the Serenissima, especially the Council of Ten. The mechanics of the republic despise every monarchical aspect, which is why the 'Ten' prepared a declaration for the Doge. The other councils backed that move. $MONARCH$ will be compelled to give some of his competences to other councils, saving the republic in these days from tyrannical tensions. If $MONARCH$ won't do that, well ... It should be mentioned that Vitale Michiel was murdered because of his failed policies."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA34: "The Doge will sign the declaration."

 venetian_republic.EVTNAME36: "Problems for the Doge"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC36: "The latest intervention of $MONARCH$ against common law has severe consequences. The Doge isn't the ruler, but only the highest representative in the Serenissima, and as such committed a crime. A tribunal was held in the Palazzo Ducale, in which $MONARCH$ was allowed to make his point of view clear."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA36: "The Doge is the slave of the republic."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTB36: "The Doge needs to balance the councils."

 venetian_republic.EVTDESC37: "The current Doge has committed a crime. At the moment, that shouldn't be a problem. But in the future, $MONARCH$ shouldn't intervene in the matters of the republic, if he doesn't want to get into trouble."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA37: "Mi?"
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME38: "A last warning"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC38: "The current Doge has committed a crime - a second time. Isn't a warning enough? Stop that. The next time, $MONARCH$ will have to deal with unforeseeable consequences, if he doesn't quit his silly ambitions. Remember Marin Falier!"
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME39: "The Trial of $MONARCH$"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC39: "It was a long, embarrassing tribunal for $MONARCH$, once a powerful Doge. The judges hadn't any mercy. $MONARCH$ was accused of treason, abuse of power, corruption and other charges. The judges added that the Doge had ruined the image of the republic in an unforgivable manner. Rumours came up that he even tried to overthrow the republic, anonymous circles talked about a conspiracy. It was a black day for $MONARCH$, but a glorious one for the republic. He couldn't see the glory. It was his last day as a Doge - and his last one on earth."

 venetian_republic.EVTNAME40: "The perfect moment"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC40: "The Consiglio dei X? Weak! The other councils? Negligible. $MONARCH$ has accumulated a power, which no one ever considered to be possible. He is the dominating power of the state. He may change the face of this country - forever. No opposition. This may be the beginning of something new. Something better. The army, the navy, the guards are on his side. Even some of the most important nobiluomini, once convinced republicans. The wind whispers softly... kairos..."

 venetian_republic.EVTDESC42: "It has become obvious that a certain institution in our government - it should be better to not mention the name of it - has assumed leadership in all political matters and is terrorizing the republic, whereas other councils are too weak to oppose the menace. Several members of those councils, allied with members of the Quarantia or the Collegio dei Savi tried to counter this influence, asking the Doge to help the group in their effort."

 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA43: "Viva San Marco!"
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME44: "The Conspiracy of $MONARCH$"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC44: "People are weak. When the conspiracy was planned, $MONARCH$ only participated in an attempt to regain a certain balance in the system. But when the 'traitors of the republic' were revealed, everyone made the Doge responsible for the unfortunate events. In fact, even the members of the rival council, who initiated the whole thing, claimed that the Doge was the mastermind. The councillors sacrificed a pawn to save their own lives. The conspiracy would go down in history as the 'Conspiracy of $MONARCH$', and the dominating force in our country would gain more power than ever."

 venetian_republic.EVTNAME47: "The case of $MONARCH$"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC47: "Historically, under the Doge Francesco Foscari Venice expanded into the Terraferma and changed some of its traditional policies. Foscari showed great virtue and political foresight. On the other hand, he accumulated more power than most of his predecessors. The Council of Ten searched for a way to turn back the clock, limiting once again the powers of the Doge. The same case goes for $MONARCH$. In $YEAR$, they found the right moment to renounce the competences of the Doge, damaging his status and making him weak again."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA47: "Sic transit gloria mundi."
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME48: "Case nuove, Case vecchie"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC48: "Since the 14th century, a constant rivalry between the Case Vecchie (old families) and the Case Nuove (new families) kept Venice in suspense. The new families gained the upper hand in that period and tried to keep the old families outside of the most important offices. Historically, from 1382 until 1612, the new families were able to elect only Doges from their 'houses'. Some say, that this tradition has to change."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA48: "Support the new families."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTB48: "Support the old families."
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME49: "Case novissime"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC49: "War, pestilence and expiring dynasties took a toll on the composition of the Maggior Consiglio. Notable families died out, and the assembly shrank in recent years. On the other hand, this change led to a more effective Great Council. Some statesmen suggest that we should let new families participate in the political process, if they are able to pay a certain fee."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA49: "They are welcome. And their money, too."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTB49: "Never!"
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME50: "Barnabotti"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC50: "The Barnabotti were a class of impoverished nobility found in the Venetian Republic towards the end of the Republican period. The term Barnabotti derives from the fact that the group met and lived in the zone of the Campo San Barnaba. The term Barnabotti refers to those patricians who, despite having lost much of their fortune, continued by law to maintain their seat in the Great Council of Venice, the assembly that governed the Venetian city and state. Although they maintained a position of political influence, due to their impoverishment the Barnabotti as a group were frequently involved in disputes with the rest of the nobility. Their lack of means, however, meant that they were susceptible to vote buying. Some suggest that we should exclude the Barnabotti from the Great Council, making it more efficient. Others are afraid that this may lead to social unrest."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA50: "They are still nobiluomini."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTB50: "Exclude them!"

 venetian_republic.EVTNAME61: "New Terraferma province"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC61: "In contrast to modern Florentine propaganda Venice never attempted to dominate the 'Terraferma' (mainland) of Italy or establish an 'imperial' rule. The Maggior Consiglio was a congress of merchantmen who desired to gain benefits for their trade. The conquest of Brescia and Verona - historically happened at the beginning of the 15th century - was done to secure economical and trade interests after the War of Chioggia, when Venice faced severe problems without a safe hinterland. Land expansion was seen as a serious threat to the traditional interests in Mediterranean trade and was viewed sceptical by notable patricians. Every expansion beyond the coast had an impact on the republican tradition of the Serenissima, which relied on trade, ships and a mighty armada, not on fortresses and armies."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA61: "The lion has only one paw on land"
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME62: "Venetian Terraferma conquered"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC62: "My Lord, we have gained parts of the so-called 'Terraferma' which was once owned by those wannabe traders. We assure you, that we have destroyed everything which remembered their presence."

 venetian_republic.EVTNAME63: "Venetian Terraferma lost"

 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA63: "We never wanted to own this land at all."

 venetian_republic.EVTNAME70: "Crossbow training"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC70: "A tradition of individual training for defence of the state and its fleets was deeply ingrained in Venetians. All male citizens had been expected to practise with the crossbow since the thirteenth century. The main purpose of this training was to provide bowmen to defend the galleys. The gradual decline of the relative utility of the crossbow in the fifteenth century contributed to a lessening in the enthusiasm for this training. It was noted in the Senate that the posts of noble bowman on the galleys (four were nominated to each galley) were being monopolized by a small number of men who were the only ones who bothered to keep up the training. This was seen as being not only damaging to the defensive capabilities of the city's population, but also a dangerously oligarchical socio-political trend, as the post of the noble archer was regarded as one of the first rungs on the ladder of a political career. Some Senators of the 'giovanni'-party claimed that this would be chance to get rid of this tradition and concentrate on Terraferma politics."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA70: "Keep the traditions strong"
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTB70: "Our politics have changed"
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTC70: "Yearly tournaments will keep them trained"
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME71: "Crossbow training revival"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC71: "After a heated debate about crossbow-trainings for Venetians in the 1440s, efforts were made to ensure that the 150 nobles who went each year as archers on the galleys were suitable skilled in the use of the crossbow. In 1460 a third annual competition was introduced, on the feast of St. Bartolomew in August. A new generation of experienced bowmen will keep our navy strong and the sea safe."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA71: "Our decision was right"
 venetian_republic.EVTNAME72: "Crossbow outdated"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC72: "By 1500 it was being recognized that the crossbow was being superseded by the handgun even at sea, which led to a new crisis regarding the venetian crossbow tradition among nobles. A new debate erupted. Some were in favor of new competitions, introducing the new weapon and changing the actual system; however, the 'giovanni' claimed that this money would be better spend for an army reform."
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTA72: "Gun competitions for our naval officers"
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTB72: "Our army is more important"
 venetian_republic.EVTOPTC72: "This is too expensive..."

 venetian_republic.EVTNAME73: "The Loggia of Brescia"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC73: "The Palazzo della Loggia - or simply: La Loggia - was planned as an expression of 'buon governo' (good government) of the Serenissima. Brescia, even if a Lombard city, was heavily influenced by venetian culture. The old aristocracy, like the Avogadro family, became part of venetian nobility and showed fidelity to Venice. The city had - like other Lombard dominions - privileges in the Terraferma and felt much better under the venetian government than under the more direct Visconti rule. The Loggia became symbol of 'Venice's most loyal city', which remained always at the sight of the Serenissima, even when threated by war and pillage."

 venetian_republic.EVTNAME74: "Prato della Valle"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC74: "Prato della Valle is a 90,000 square meter elliptical square in Padova. It is the largest square in Italy, and one of the largest in Europe. In $YEAR$ Andrea Memmo decided to reclaim and restructure the entire area. The entire project, which was never fully completed, is represented in a famous copper engraving by Francesco Piranesi from 1785. It seems that Memmo had commissioned this and other representations and kept them on exhibition at the Palazzo Venezia, the headquarters of the Embassy of the Republic in Rome. He did this in order to entice other important figures into financing the construction of statues to decorate the square. The project was approved by Domenico Cerato, professor of architecture at Vicenza and Padova. Today there are 78 statues (40 in the exterior ring and 38 statues in the inner ring), following the original plan there had been 88 statues. Among the numerous statues in the square, one represents Andrea Memmo, the patrician Venetian known as the provider of Padova."

 venetian_republic.EVTNAME75: "Scipio Maffei's Verona illustrata"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC75: "Francesco Scipione, marchese di Maffei, was an Italian writer and art critic, author of many articles and plays. An antiquarian with a humanist education whose publications on Etruscan antiquities stand as incunabula of Etruscology, he engaged in running skirmishes in print with his rival in the field of antiquities, Antonio Francesco Gori. In 1710, he spent some time studying the manuscripts in the Royal Library at Turin; while there he arranged the collection of objects of art which the late Carlo Emanuele, Duke of Savoy had brought from Rome. From 1718 he became especially interested in the archaeology of his native town, and his investigations resulted in the valuable Verona illustrata (1731–1732). Maffei devoted the years 1732-1736 to travel in France, England, the Netherlands and Germany. On his return to Verona, he built a museum, which he bequeathed, together with his valuable archaeological and artistic collection, to his native city. He bequeathed his collection of manuscripts to the canons of the cathedral of Verona."

 venetian_republic.EVTNAME76: "Aldo Manuzio"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC76: "Aldus Pius Manutius was born in Bassiano, in the Papal States. His family was well off and Manutius was educated as a humanistic scholar. In 1482 he went to reside at Mirandola with his old friend and fellow student, the illustrious Giovanni Pico. There he stayed two years, pursuing his studies in Greek literature. Before Pico moved to Florence, he procured for Manutius the post of tutor to his nephews, Alberto and Lionello Pio, princes of Carpi. Alberto Pio supplied Manutius with funds for starting his printing press. The leading publisher and printer of the Venetian High Renaissance, Aldus set up a definite scheme of book design, produced the first italic type, introduced small and handy pocket editions (octavos) of the classics, and applied several innovations in binding technique and design for use on a broad scheme. He commissioned Francesco Griffo to cut a slanted type known today as italic. In 1501, Aldus began to use, as his publisher's device, the image of a dolphin wrapped around an anchor. His editions of the classics were so highly respected that the dolphin-and-anchor device was almost immediately pirated by French and Italian publishers. The dolphin and anchor emblem is associated with 'Festina lente' (Hasten slowly), a motto that Aldus had begun to use as early as 1499, after receiving a Roman coin from Pietro Bembo, which bore the emblem and motto. Manutius desired to preserve ancient Greek literature by printing editions of its greatest books. He introduced personal or pocket editions of the classics in Greek and Latin that all could own. Scholars admired his editions and the work that he undertook to edit these ancient texts. Manutius is also believed to have been the first typographer to use a semicolon."

Besides these charitable aspects, they were also convents and music schools. Children with a good voice became singers; the others had to learn an instrument. This way, Venice solved this social problem and also had a neverending source of musicians for its festivities. Each Hospital had an orchestra of at least thirty to forty elements, all females (La Pietà's orchestra counted up to sixty) and competed with each other by hiring the best musicians in the city, promoting high quality concerts, and through such activities provided countless commissions for violin and other instruments makers to provide for the maintenance and repair of such instruments. Much of Vivaldi's sacred vocal and instrumental music was written for performance at the Ospedale della Pietà, which produced many virtuose and at least two composers: Anna Bon and Vincenta Da Ponte."

In contrary to these times, the gondolas of the 16th century were still coloured and had no standard style. There were red, blue, even golden gondolas. The patricians liked to show what they had, and a luxury gondola became a symbol of influence and power. However, there were different opinions about the matter. In the second half of the 16th century, a group of so-called 'moralists' claimed that this development was also a symbol of vanity and extravagance. Others said, that this 'inordinate expenditures' could have been spent elsewhere. The Serenissima had to debate over a new sumptuary law."

 venetian_republic.EVTDESC79: "Il Ridotto was the site of the West's first public, legal mercantile casino. The term 'ridotto' comes from the Italian word 'ridurre', meaning to 'close off' or 'make private'. It originally referred to several illegal, privately owned gambling clubs that offered games of chance to members of Venice's nobility in the city's Rialto District. These clubs came into being after the Venetian authorities attempted to ban games of chance that had spontaneously sprung up in the city's streets. Realizing it could not effectively prevent citizens from wagering on dice and card games, the Great Council of Venice opened its 'Ridotto' in 1638 on the occasion of the city's annual Spring Carnival. As for games, Il Ridotto is known to have offered biribi and basetta. Biribi was a lottery-like game in which players placed bets on one of 70 possible outcomes. A casino employee, the 'banker', would then draw a number from a bag, and anyone who had bet on that number would win the game's pot. The most popular game at Il Ridotto, however, was basetta. This game was a cross between blackjack, poker and gin rummy and offered winning players 60 times their wagers in payout. In later years it was replaced by faro."

 venetian_republic.EVTNAME82: "Carlo Goldoni"
 venetian_republic.EVTDESC82: "Carlo Osvaldo Goldoni was an Italian playwright and librettist from the Republic of Venice. His works include some of Italy's most famous and best-loved plays. Audiences have admired the plays of Goldoni for their ingenious mix of wit and honesty. His plays offered his contemporaries images of themselves, often dramatizing the lives, values, and conflicts of the emerging middle classes. Though he wrote in French and Italian, his plays make rich use of the Venetian language, regional vernacular, and colloquialisms. Goldoni, a prolific writer, is best known for his comic play 'Servant of Two Masters', which has been translated and adapted internationally numerous times. After 1748, Goldoni collaborated with the composer Baldassare Galuppi, making significant contributions to the new form of 'opera buffa'. Galuppi composed the score for more than twenty of Goldoni's librettos. As with his comedies, Goldoni's opera buffa integrate elements of the Commedia dell'arte with recognisable local and middle-class realities. In his 'Memoirs' Goldoni amply discusses the state of Italian comedy when he began writing. At that time, Italian comedy revolved around the conventionality of the Commedia dell'arte, or improvised comedy. Goldoni took to himself the task of superseding the comedy of masks and the comedy of intrigue by representations of actual life and manners. He rightly maintained that Italian life and manners were susceptible of artistic treatment such as had not been given them before."

In fact, he travelled a lot through Europe on his 'Grand Tour', meeting other philosophers and even high ranking nobles. However, our spie... well-posted scouts informed the Dieci that this man is an immoral, maybe dangerous subject. He has connections to the society of Freemasonry and seems to be an expert on the obscure field of cabalism. We are also informed about a library of forbidden books, including satanic writings and other materials. There are also some delicate... rumours about his private life, which were mentioned in a report by the police of Paris.

 violate_promessione_desc: "In the early years of the republic, the Doge ruled Venice in an autocratic fashion, but later his powers were limited by the promissione, a pledge he had to take when elected. As a result, powers were shared with the Maggior Consiglio or Great Council, composed of members taken from patrician families, so that 'He could do nothing without the Major Council and the Major Council could do nothing without him' (according to Marino Sanudo). Nevertheless, even in later periods, a strong Doge could violate the rules in attempt to gain influence in the state, even if that would signify a destabilization of the republic as a whole."

The Maggior Consiglio was a congress of merchantmen who desired to gain benefits for their trade. The conquest of Brescia and Verona - historically happened at the beginning of the 15th century - was done to secure economical and trade interests after the War of Chioggia, when Venice faced severe problems without a safe hinterland. Land expansion was seen as a serious threat to the traditional interests in Mediterranean trade and was viewed sceptical by notable patricians. Every expansion beyond the coast had an impact on the republican tradition of the Serenissima, which relied on trade, ships and a mighty armada, not on fortresses and armies. A new administration for our mainland provinces would lead to a better integration of these provinces and encourage the nobility to participate in the 'Terraferma' affairs."

 organise_sensa_desc: "The Festa della Sensa (or Ascension Day Festival) commemorates a historical event that took place on Ascension Day, May the 9th 1000. On that day, Doge Pietro Orseolo II left Venice at the head of a great fleet, to defend the inhabitants of Zara and Dalmatia against the incursions of the Croatians and Narentines. Before leaving, the Doge boarded the ceremonial galley, the Bucintoro, and set out to sea along the San Nicolò di Lido canal, while the Bishop of Venice gave his blessing to the Adriatic. Having reached the mouth of the harbour, the Doge then threw a golden ring into the sea to symbolically marry Venice to the sea and demonstrate the Serenissima's domination of the gulf. The Sensa was one of the most splendid festivals in Italy, known through Europe, and as prestigious as it was costly."

 festa_sensa.EVTNAME0: "Desponsamus te, mare"
 festa_sensa.EVTDESC0: "The 'Marriage of the Adriatic', or more correctly 'Marriage of the Sea' (in Italian, Sposalizio del Mare), was a ceremony symbolizing the maritime dominion of Venice. The ceremony, established about 1000 to commemorate the Doge Pietro II Orseolo's conquest of Dalmatia, was originally one of supplication and placation, Ascension Day being chosen as the day on which the Doge set out on his expedition. The form it took was a solemn procession of boats, headed by the Doge's nave (ship), from 1311 the Bucentaur, out to sea by the Lido port. A prayer was offered that 'for us and all who sail thereon the sea may be calm and quiet', whereupon the doge and the others were solemnly anointed with holy water, the rest of which was thrown into the sea while the priests chanted 'Asperges me hyssopo, et mundabor' ('Sprinkle me with hyssop, and I will be clean' – Psalm 51:7). To this ancient ceremony a quasi-sacramental character was given by Pope Alexander III in 1177, in return for the services rendered by Venice in the struggle against the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I. The pope drew a ring from his finger and, giving it to the doge, bade him cast such a one into the sea each year on Ascension Day, and so wed the sea. Henceforth the ceremonial, instead of placatory and expiatory, became nuptial. Every year the doge dropped a consecrated ring into the sea, and with the Latin words 'Desponsamus te, mare, in signum veri perpetuique domini' ('We wed thee, sea, in the sign of the true and everlasting Lord') declared Venice and the sea to be indissolubly one."

The last and most magnificent of the historic bucentaurs made its maiden voyage in 1729 in the reign of Doge Alvise III Sebastiano Mocenigo. Depicted in paintings by Canaletto and Francesco Guardi, the ship was 35 m (115 ft) long and more than 8 metres (26 ft) high. A two-deck floating palace, its main salon had a seating capacity of 90. The Doge's throne was in the stern, and the prow bore a figurehead representing Justice with sword and scales. The barge was propelled by 168 oarsmen, and another 40 sailors were required to man it.

But even if the conflict cooled down, there is still the heritage of more than three centuries of expansion, naval ambitions, merchant adventures and wars. Small colonies in the Adria, the Agean Sea and the Black Sea are still there. Some of them - like Amasra and Focea - consist only of a city with a surrounding area. Others, like the famous fortresses of Modon and Coron, are important strategic points to ensure control over trade routes. These minor holdings are threatened by bigger powers, who may seize these possessions and destroy the Italian trade power in these nodes. And even besides that, there is still Cyprus. Cyprus, the island of sugar. The odour of sweet fortune. The white gold. The resource of a once glorious Kingdom, which claims to be Jerusalem itself. De jure a vassal of the Mamelucks, Cyprus is a de facto protectorate of Genoa. The last bastion of Genoese wealth and trade dominance. Here, Venetians and Genoese will clash a last time.

This method will be much safer and our enemy will be more interested to accept this deal. The diplomatic skill of our $MONARCHTITLE$ has an important effect on the outcome. In the case of success, our possession will be safe for ten years - but if our negations fail, our country will be destabilized, too. In both cases - warning and tribute - we will at least have a claim to conquer the province in which our conquered possession took place. We also may not interfere in any way. We won't have a claim or a casus belli against $FROMCOUNTRY$, but our government won't be destabilised if the outcome of our negotiations are negative."

The $FROM_ADJ$ ambassador underlined the value of peace and wealth for both countries, and how unfortunate it would be for both countries if we go to war - intending that, if we don't accept, [From.GetName] may see an attack on $FROM_ADJ$ territory as a casus belli.

 desc_medici_system_information: "Different classes represent the society of Florence: the Merchants (mercanti), the Artisans (artigiani) and the common People (popolo). The Medici were able to establish their rule over the city because they acted as the godfathers of the people. You have a problem? Good old Cosimo will solve it for you! That was the base of the Medici power in the republic, which was only possible with the wealth of the famous Medici bank. There exist four different phases of favour: ignored (0-3 favour points), known (4-6 favour points), esteemed (7-9) and loved (10 or more favour points). Showing your greatness, enacting decisions, events and the election of a Gonfaloniere may change the favour points. If the Medici are able to enact the most important decisions and gain the favour of all classes ('loved'), than they may abolish the office of the Gonfaloniere. If they do so, the successor of the current Medici will become the first Signore of Florence, establishing the dynasty for future generations. If Cosimo dies before he does that, his son Piero may follow; after Piero follows Lorenzo. But if Lorenzo is not able to establish the Medici rule forever, the Florentine republic will return to a normal one, with elected Gonfalioneri, and without the benefits of the Medici system. One further note... gaining favour costs money. Founding new banks will push your income!"

 medici_system.EVTNAME0: "The Grey Eminence of Florence"
 medici_system.EVTDESC0: "The House of Medici was a political dynasty and banking family that first began to gather prominence under Cosimo de' Medici in the Republic of Florence during the late 14th century. The family originated in the Mugello region of the Tuscan countryside, gradually rising until they were able to found the Medici Bank. The bank was the largest in Europe during the 15th century, seeing the Medici gain political power in Florence — though officially they remained citizens rather than monarchs. Their wealth and influence initially derived from the textile trade guided by the guild of the Arte della Lana. Like other signore families they dominated their city's government, they were able to bring Florence under their family's power, allowing for an environment where art and humanism could flourish. They fostered and inspired the birth of the Italian Renaissance along with other families of Italy, such as the Visconti and Sforza of Milan, the Este of Ferrara, and the Gonzaga of Mantua. The Medici Bank was one of the most prosperous and most respected institutions in Europe. There are some estimates that the Medici family were the wealthiest family in Europe for a period of time. From this base, they acquired political power initially in Florence and later in wider Italy and Europe. In 1433 Cosimo's power over Florence, which he exerted without occupying public office, began to look like a menace to the anti-Medici party, led by figures such as Palla Strozzi and Rinaldo degli Albizzi: in September of that year he was imprisoned, accused for the failure of the conquest of Lucca, but he managed to turn the jail term into one of exile. He went to Padua and then to Venice, taking his bank along with him. A year later, when the rivals of the Medici - the house of Albizzi - lost their power in Florence, Cosimo de' Medici returned and gained full control over the republic. Cosimo's time in exile instilled in him the need to squash the factionalism that resulted in his exile in the first place. In order to do this, Cosimo, with the help of favourable priors in the Signoria, instigated a series of constitutional changes to secure his power through influence. It would be the beginning of the 'hidden Signoria' of Florence, in which the Medici seek to install their dynasty forever."

 medici_system.EVTNAME1: "The Death of Cosimo de' Medici"
 medici_system.EVTDESC1: "Cosimo de' Medici was the first 'de facto' ruler of Florence. Born the 27th of September 1389, he was the son of Giovanni di Bicci de Medici, the founder of the Banco Medici. He followed his father's steps since a young age, working alongside him and becoming a banker. In 1415 Cosimo became an ambassador for the city of Florence and he travelled a lot across the peninsula and made his first steps in politics. Following the death of his father in 1429 he inherited a vast wealth which he immediately put to use. While Giovanni was first and foremost a banker, Cosimo saw in the meddling with Florentine politics the next natural step in his career. His rise was fast and impressive. Cosimo never held any public office except the position of Gonfaloniere di giustizia, preferring instead to pull the strings of his men, put into key positions. By 1433 his influence was so big that it was bound to cause jealousy and resentment among the old aristocratic families of Florence. Blaming him for the failure of the campaign against the city of Lucca, Palla Strozzi and Rinaldo degli Abizzi managed to cause his imprisonment. Cosimo was accused of being a 'magnate', a tyrant. He managed to oil the cogwheels in the right places, though, and the sentence was commuted to exile, the first exile of the Medici. Cosimo went to Venice, where he was treated like a monarch in official visit. From there he planned his return, and in less than a year he was back. He made a triumphal return in 1434, acclaimed by the people. While his power in Florence was absolute, he was always formally respectful of the republican tradition of the city. Reputed by most a just ruler, he knew how to rule with an iron fist in times of necessity, and when Bernando d'Anghiari, one of his opponents, was thrown from a tower and killed, he said that 'While an enemy who falls from a tower isn't exactly helpful, on the other hand he also cannot harm anyone anymore.'\n Cosimo the Elder died in $YEAR$. Cosimo left a vast financial empire and an even larger network of political connections to his son Piero, known as the 'gouty', whom under many aspects was far less successful than his father, had to face a renewed internal opposition to the Medici rule."

 medici_system.EVTDESC2: "Piero de Medici (known as the 'gouty') always had a sickly health. When his father Cosimo was still alive and running the Banco Medici, he never partecipated to the family business, preferring instead to focus on his humanist studies and on his interests in literature. When Cosimo the Elder died, Piero succeeded to the lead of the Banco Medici. The transition wasn't easy: as first measure, Piero decided to recall a number of loans to many supporters of the Medici. That caused many bankruptcies and the Medici lost many political allies. Piero had then to face a renewed and bigger opposition, and it didn't take long for those who hated the Medici to act against him. Piero's reign on Florence was troubled by political opposition, but he managed to survive it and to continue the policy of supporting the arts that was of his father Cosimo. In $YEAR$, following Piero's death, the Banco Medici was inherited by his clever and competent son Lorenzo, who would later become known as Lorenzo the Magnificent. Lorenzo, groomed for power since his birth, skilled jouster, hunter, horse breeder, art patron and poet, was the epitome of the Renaissance prince, but who knows what sort of threat might be hidden for him? The rival families haven't forgotten what Florence was before the Medici took the power for themselves, and would return to those times if they could (or to simply replace the Medici with themselves.) They are only waiting for the right time to strike. "

It's also said that a lightning struck the tower of the church of Santa Separata in the moment of his death. We can't know for sure. What we know is that Lorenzo has no heir, and the dominion of the Medici over Florence seems over. Important characters and families of the town are already negotiating the transition. Although some would like to become the new Signori of the town, no one has even half of the strength the Medici had. Most are calling for a restoration of the Republic. A new Gonfaloniere is being elected, and the people of Florence vow that no one will rule over their city like a king. Will it be so? The Medici showed the world that it is possible to ascend to absolute power with enough cunning, and more than a few would like to follow their example. In the meanwhile, dark clouds gather on the horizon as more and more citizens listen to the words of the zealous Savonarola, whose flaming sermons are a violent accuse towards the bankers, enemies of God, and the Pope."

 medici_system.EVTDESC5: "The Medici, after lengthy negotiation, have decided to open a branch of the Banco Medici in $CAPITAL_CITY$. It will have a positive effect on our economy, and it will strengthen our relation with Florence. Branches of the Banco Medici were de facto independent from the main Medici Bank in Florence. Its legal structure resembled that of a modern holding company. Florence owned the lion's share of shares in each branch, but there would also be independent partnerships. The branch manager, or governor, would be picked among the partners, and he would receive a bigger share of the dividends, which were distributed among the shareholders each year on March 24, after a thorough examination of the books. The first branch was opened in Rome contemporary to the founding of the Banco Medici proper, in 1397, under Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici. Five years later, in 1402, a new branch was opened in Venice, which was the first branch to start the practice to reward the general manager with shares of the branch rather than with a salary. While the Medici built factories for the production of woolen cloth, the Rome branch of the Banco Medici opened a branch in Naples (closed in 1425 and replaced with one in Geneva) and Gaeta. When Giovanni died in 1429 the bank was wealthy, numbering 180.000 gold florins in value. The transition to Cosimo was smooth, and under him the Banco Medici flourished and became the wealthiest bank in Europe. More branches were later opened in Bruges, Pisa, Lyons, London, Avignon and Milan. Those branches would then invest in a number of activities to increments its dividends, such as production of textiles and mining. The florin had become, by then, the international value of Europe, and Medici would loan money to many monarchs and kings. The Medici became the wealthiest family in Europe thanks to this complex web of investments."

The fight was quick, but not bloodless, and there were casualties on each side. Our troops immediately walked to the vault, forced a clerk to open it... and to the horror of everyone, found it empty. The Florentine must have used those hours to slip the gold out through a secret passage.\n 'They cannot be far', said the captain of the guards. 'Quickly, dispatch patrols: I want every inch of the town and the surrounding countryside searched.' In the afternoon, ten miles from $CAPITAL_CITY$, in a small patch of woods, a group of soldiers stopped a wagon carrying, allegedly, sacks of flours. The two merchants were extremely nervous, and that suspected the soldiers. When it became clear that the guards would have checked the sacks and opened them, the two men reached for crossbows and daggers hidden under their clothes. They shot one of our men, and tried to make a run for it. To no avail. They got caught shortly after their attempt, and one is now in jail, while the second died of his wounds.\n Later the wagon was escorted back to the city. It must have been a peculiar sight for the commoners; fifty armed soldiers on horses escorting a single cart. What might it contain? They will never know the truth. $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ knew though, and he smiled as he heard from his guards that a small fortune in florins of the Banco Medici was being brought to the cellar of his palace."

In the good old times of the Comune, back in the 12th century, when happy little Italians could have their fights without the intervention of megalomaniac strangers who wanted to take plunder or base tax, there were two famous alliances: Florence, Genoa and Lucca on one side, Pisa and Siena on the other. Pisa was beaten by the Genoese on water at the end of the 13th century, and later on land by the Florentines. The great merchant city, from the 11th to the 13th century the most important of central Italy, lost its power, its glory, its greatness. Old families like the Alliata, the della Gherardesca, the Roncioni and the Caetani has moved to foreign lands. The city has lost size. Everything is in decay. The hard rule of Florentine governors, who wanted to smash every rebellion, are responsible for this. Pisa lays at mouth of the river Arno, which connects Florence with the Sea and worldwide commerce. Without the control of Pisa, Florence can't flourish. So, the treatment became harder, and Pisa suffered more. But in the last months, in the last weeks, something changed. Conspiracies, some say. Paranoia, others replied.

His was the Golden Age of arts in Florence, under the patronage of Lorenzo il Magnifico. Among his works are the Primavera, the Adoration of the Magi, the well-known Birth of Venus, and an illustrated edition of Dante's Inferno. Avid reader, passionate student of the Ancients' culture, with a restless mind and a troubled soul, Botticelli exemplifies the character of early humanists, the continuation in spirit of people like Roger Bacon, Petrarch or Salutati, in league with contemporary polymaths and scholars like Leonardo da Vinci, Michelangelo or Bessarion, and that would give way to the Enlightenment of Voltaire, Rousseau or Lavoisier. \n In later years, something was stirring in the depths of his soul, some kind of void that only Savonarola's preaching could fill. In full repentance, he quit painting for a while, and the few painting he did from then on was almost always of religious theme, and his style changed gradually into mystical, exaggerate expressiveness. During his time in the Piagnone company, he was accused of sodomy and of 'keeping a boy'. Unsatisfied and bitter, he continued on without much notoriety, and died alone and penniless. \n His fame was eclipsed by the new generation of great artists (this may be why there's no Ninja Turtle called Botticelli), and it wasn't until the XIXth Century that he was vindicated as one of the most important artists of his time."

A man of great passion, hothead temperament and immense charisma, he met and impressed both Lorenzo the Magnificent and Marsilio Ficino, turning them into friends and protectors, as well as Savonarola, of whom he'd become later on one of the pillars of his 'New Jerusalem' in Florence. \n Born of a noble family of lords with wide connections, he was destined to the Church, but he quit the seminars to attend the University of Padua, where he soaked in the rediscovered classical texts that Greek scholars had brought with them from lost Constantinople. His interest in Aristotelian thought brought him to all the humanist centers of Italy, and eventually to Paris, the center of Scholastics. He studied Arab philosophers and scientists, Jewish texts and sought avidly more remains of Classical thought, and also the works of mystics, manicheans, Zoroastrians and gnostics, in his efforts to better understand the world and reconcile the opposed schools of Plato and Aristotle. \n His life of wandering ended when Pope Innocent VIII banned him from defending his 900 Thesis in Rome, when he was only 23, accusing him of heretic and of 'repeating the errors of pagan philosophers'. He fled and was captured several times, always released by intercession of Lorenzo de Medici. He settled down in Florence, where he kept on writing until Savonarola began his preaching. Then, Pico renounced his former ideas, became a monk and burned his poetry and manuscripts. He died of poisoning at age 41, probably by order of Piero de Medici, for being one of Savonarola's supports."

While he failed in his efforts to synthesize Christianity with Neoplatonism, his works, his translations of Platonic texts and Hermetic commentaries into Latin, and his actualization of Platonism to the XVth Century mindset made him one of the most influential humanists of all the Renaissance. \n 'There will be some men or other, superstitious and blind, who see life plain in even the lowest animals and the meanest plants, but do not see life in the heavens or the world ...

One of the most exquisite goods was porcelain, which was considered a precious good like glassware. And like glassware, it's production was a secret. The Medici porcelain was the first successful attempt in Europe to make imitations of Chinese porcelain. Historically, the experimental manufactory housed in the Casino of San Marco in Florence existed between 1575 and 1587 under the patronage of Francesco I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany. A painted mark of Brunelleschi's dome and a capital letter F appeared on the underside of some pieces; others beared the Medici palle, the balls that are the Medici heraldic charge. Never a commercial venture, Medici porcelains were sometimes given as diplomatic gifts; for example, surviving pieces bear the arms of Philip II of Spain. The first successes were finally reported in $YEAR$ by the Venetian ambassador Andrea Gussoni, who mentioned in his brief to the Serenissima that $MONARCH$ discovered the means of making 'the porcelain of India.'"

 medici_system.EVTNAME58: "Galileo Galilei"
 medici_system.EVTDESC58: "Galileo Galilei was an Italian physicist, mathematician, astronomer, and philosopher who played a major role in the Scientific Revolution. His achievements include improvements to the telescope and consequent astronomical observations and support for Copernicanism. Galileo has been called the 'father of modern observational astronomy', the 'father of modern physics', the 'father of science', and 'the Father of Modern Science'. His contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus, the discovery of the four largest satellites of Jupiter (named the Galilean moons in his honour), and the observation and analysis of sunspots. Galileo also worked in applied science and technology, inventing an improved military compass and other instruments. In 1589, he was appointed to the chair of mathematics in Pisa. In 1591, his father died and he was entrusted with the care of his younger brother Michelagnolo. In 1592, he moved to the University of Padua, teaching geometry, mechanics, and astronomy until 1610. During this period, Galileo made significant discoveries in both pure fundamental science (for example, kinematics of motion and astronomy) as well as practical applied science (for example, strength of materials and improvement of the telescope). His multiple interests included the study of astrology, which at the time was a discipline tied to the studies of mathematics and astronomy. In $YEAR$, he returned to Florenz, famed as one of the greatest scientists of Europe."

 medici_system.EVTNAME59: "The Assayer"
 medici_system.EVTDESC59: "The Assayer (Il Saggiatore) was a polemic against the treatise on the comets of 1618 by Orazio Grassi, a Jesuit mathematician at the Collegio Romano. In this matter Grassi, for all his Aristotelianism, was right and Galileo was wrong. Galileo incorrectly treated the comets as a play of light rather than as real objects. In 1616 Galileo may have been silenced on Copernicanism. In 1623 his supporter and friend, Cardinal Maffeo Barberini, a former patron of the Lynx and uncle of Cardinal Francesco Barberini, became Pope Urban VIII. The election of Barberini seemed to assure Galileo of support at the highest level in the Church. A visit to Rome confirmed this. Galileo insisted that physics should be mathematical. According to the title page, he was the philosopher or physicist of the Grand Duke of Tuscany, not merely the mathematician. Physics or natural philosophy spans the gamut from processes of generation and growth (represented by a plant) to the physical structure of the universe, represented by the cosmic cross-section. Mathematics, on the other hand, is symbolized by telescopes, and an astrolabe. This is the book containing Galileo's famous statement that mathematics is the language of science. Only through mathematics can one achieve lasting truth in physics. Those who neglect mathematics wander endlessly in a dark labyrinth. \n Although The Assayer contains a magnificent polemic for mathematical physics, ironically its main point was to ridicule a mathematical astronomer. This time, the target of Galileo's wit and sarcasm was the cometary theory of a Jesuit, Orazio Grassi, who argued from parallax that comets move above the Moon. Galileo mistakenly countered that comets are an optical illusion."

Simplicio's arguments are systematically refuted and ridiculed by the other two characters, which reduces Simplicio to baffled rage, and makes the author's position unambiguous. Indeed, although Galileo states in the preface of his book that the character is named after a famous Aristotelian philosopher (Simplicius in Latin, Simplicio in Italian), the name 'Simplicio' in Italian also had the connotation of 'simpleton.' Pope Urban's demand for his own arguments to be included in the book resulted in Galileo putting them in the mouth of Simplicio. Some months after the book's publication, Pope Urban VIII banned its sale and had its text submitted for examination by a special commission."

Boccherini was born in Lucca, Italy, into a musical family. At a young age he was sent by his father, a cellist and double bass player, to study in Rome. Much of his chamber music follows models established by Joseph Haydn; however, Boccherini is often credited with improving Haydn's model of the string quartet by bringing the cello to prominence, whereas Haydn had frequently relegated it to an accompaniment role. Rather, some sources for Boccherini's style are in the works of a famous Italian cellist, Giovanni Battista Cirri, who was born before Boccherini and before Haydn, and in the Spanish popular music. A virtuoso cellist of high caliber, Boccherini often played violin repertoire on the cello, at pitch, a skill he developed by substituting for ailing violinists while touring. This supreme command of the instrument brought him much praise from his contemporaries (notably Pierre Baillot, Pierre Rode, and Bernhard Romberg), and is evident in the cello parts of his compositions (particularly in the quintets for two cellos, treated often as cello concertos with string quartet accompaniment).

In 1646, dressed as Harlequin during Mardi Gras and amusing bystanders with his clowning and his violin, the boy attracted the attention of Roger de Lorraine, chevalier de Guise, son of Charles, Duke of Guise, who was returning to France and was looking for someone to talk Italian with his niece, Mademoiselle de Montpensier (la Grande Mademoiselle). Guise took the boy to Paris, where the fourteen year-old entered Mademoiselle's service; from 1647 to 1652 he served as her 'chamber boy' (garçon de chambre). He probably honed his musical skills by working with Mademoiselle's household musicians and with composers Nicolas Métru, François Roberday and Nicolas Gigault. The teenager's talents as a guitarist, violinist, and dancer quickly won him the nicknames 'Baptiste', and 'le grand baladin' (great street-artist). By February 1653 Lully had attracted the attention of the heir, dancing with him in the Ballet royal de la nuit. By March 16, 1653, Lully had been made royal composer for instrumental music."

Even the number wasn't always the same. Cosimo's crest showed eleven balls, Piero reduced the number to seven, Lorenzo had only six. Later, the Medici had an interest to strengthen the old ties between France and Florence, which had an 'Auld alliance' since medieval times.

The family originated in the Mugello region of the Tuscan countryside, gradually rising until they were able to found the Medici Bank. The bank was the largest in Europe during the 15th century, seeing the Medici gain political power in Florence — though officially they remained citizens rather than monarchs. Their wealth and influence initially derived from the textile trade guided by the guild of the Arte della Lana. Like other signore families they dominated their city's government, they were able to bring Florence under their family's power, allowing for an environment where art and humanism could flourish. They fostered and inspired the birth of the Italian Renaissance along with other families of Italy, such as the Visconti and Sforza of Milan, the Este of Ferrara, and the Gonzaga of Mantua. The Medici Bank was one of the most prosperous and most respected institutions in Europe. There are some estimates that the Medici family were the wealthiest family in Europe for a period of time. From this base, they acquired political power initially in Florence and later in wider Italy and Europe. In $YEAR$, he became Gonfaloniere of Florence, establishing his system of power even more. The following Gonfalonieri would be chosen by Cosimo, whereas he would stay behind, controlling the republic. It would be the beginning of the 'hidden Signoria' of Florence, in which the Medici seek to install their dynasty forever."

The enthusiasm after the victory, however, is so extreme that the ceremony of attribution of the palio is quite instantaneous, being the first moment of a months-long celebration for the winning ward. After the festivities on the Piazza, the contradaioli go to the Duomo, the Cathedral of Siena, to celebrate a mass, which is decorated with the flag of the winning contrada.

 palio_siena.EVTNAME1: "Preparations for the Palio"
 palio_siena.EVTDESC1: "The Palio di Siena is more than a simple horse race. It is the culmination of ongoing rivalry and competition between the contrade (city quarters of Siena). The lead-up and the day of the race are invested with passion and pride. Formal and informal rituals take place as the day proceeds, with each contrada navigating a strategy of horsemanship, alliances, and animosities. There are the final clandestine meetings among the heads of the contrade and then between them and the jockeys (called Fantini in Italian). The first race (Palio di Provenzano) is held on July 2, which is both the Feast of the Visitation and the date of a local festival in honour of the Madonna of Provenzano (a painting once owned by the Sienese leader Provenzano Salvani, which was supposed to have miraculous curative power). The second race is held on August 16 (Palio dell'Assunta), the day after the Feast of the Assumption, and is likewise dedicated to the Virgin Mary. The horses (called Berberi) are of mixed breed; no purebred horses are allowed. Because of the rivalries between the contrade, Fantini were often hired from outside, because the contrade didn't trust other Sienese. In fact, the Fantino had a status similar to a mercenary who was hired to fight a battle against an enemy. Siena heavily relied on those Fantini from outside, and maybe we should send an offer to our neighbours to send us some very good jockeys for the upcoming race."

 palio_siena.EVTDESC5: "A contrada (plural: contrade) is a district, or a ward, within an Italian city. Each is named after an animal or symbol and each with its own long history and complicated set of heraldic and semi-mythological associations. These districts were set up in the Middle Ages in order to supply troops to the many military companies that were hired to defend Siena as it fought to defend its independence from Florence and other nearby city states. Their roles have broadened so that every important event – baptisms, deaths, marriages, church holidays, victories at the Palio, even wine or food festivals – is celebrated only within one's own contrada. Every contrada has its own museum, fountain and baptismal font, motto, allied contrada and adversary contrada, typically a neighbour. Often the adversary contrade share borders. Traditionally, every contrade held a large feast for its contradaioli (inhabitants of a contrada) before the great day of the Palio."

 palio_siena.EVTDESC6: "The drappellone (banner), or palio, known affectionately as 'the rag' in Siena, is the trophy that is to be delivered to the contrada that wins the Palio. The palio is an elongated rectangular piece of silk, hand-painted by an artist for the occasion. It is held vertically on a black-and-white shaft halberd and topped by a silver plate, with two white and black plumes draped down the sides. The palio, along with the plumes, remains the property of the contrada. The plate is returned to the city of Siena before the two Palii of the following year, after the date and the name of the victorious contrada are inscribed on its back. There is one silver platter for the Palio in July and another for the August Palio. The plates are replaced approximately every ten years. The value of the banner is unique, because it represents a particular historical period of the city of Siena. The process that an artist should follow in designing the palio is rigid: it must follow a precise iconography that includes some sacred symbols, as the July Palio is dedicated to the Madonna of Provenzano, and that of August to the Madonna of the Assumption. It must present the insignia of the city, those of the third part of the city, and the symbols or colors of the ten contrade participating in the race. There are, however, no limits regarding the style of the art."

 palio_siena.EVTNAME7: "Betting at the prove"
 palio_siena.EVTDESC7: "At the Palio, a lottery determines which horse will run for each contrada. Than, six trial races are run, the first on the evening of the horse selection and the last on the morning before the Palio. The devout residents of each contrada invoke the sacred aid of their patron saint for their horse and jockey. The worldly improve their odds with arguably dubious methods, chiefly bribery and doping. The sensible simply keep a close watch on their stable and their rider. The Palio differs from 'normal' horse races in that part of the game is for the wards to prevent rival contrade from winning. When a contrada fails to win, its historical enemy will celebrate that fact nearly as merrily as a victory of its own, regardless of whether adversarial interference was a deciding factor. Few things are forbidden to the jockeys during the race; for instance, they can pull or shove their fellows, hit the horses and each other, or try to hamper other horses at the start. Clearly, in all that circumstances, betting happened quite frequently, because everything could happen."

In fact, in Siena the Fantino in the second place is looked at with deepest mistrust - because he had the chance to win. That is Siena, that is Palio. On another note: in the 19th century, there was a guy called Pierre de Coubertin.

The tenth, the rincorsa, waits outside. When the rincorsa finally enters the space between the ropes the starter (mossiere) activates a mechanism that instantly drops the canapo (the front rope). This process (the mossa) can take a very long time, as deals have usually been made between various contrade and jockeys that affect when the rincorsa moves - he may be waiting for a particular other horse to be well- or badly-placed, for example. On the dangerous, steeply canted track, the riders are allowed to use their whips (in Italian, nerbi, stretched, dried bulls' hide) not only for their own horse, but also for disturbing other horses and riders. The Palio in fact is won by the horse who represents his contrada, and not by the jockeys. The winner is the first horse to cross the finish line—a horse can win without its rider (a condition known as cavallo scosso). A horse can also win without its decorative headgear (spennacchiera), although the opposite belief is widely held even among the Sienese.

He was born in 1468 near Salamanca, originally under the name Juan de Fermoselle. Fermoselle was a Chaplain at the Salamanca Cathedral in the early 1490s. It was here that he changed his name from Juan de Fermoselle to Juan del Enzina, or Encina (meaning holm oak) during his stay as Chaplain. In 1492 the poet entertained his patron with a dramatic piece, the Triunfo de la fama. In 1496 he published his Cancionero, a collection of dramatic and lyrical poems. He then applied for the cantor post at Salamanca Cathedral, but the position was divided among three singers, including his rival Lucas Fernandez. While working for the Duke of Alba, Encina was the program director, along with Lucas Fernandez. Here Encina wrote pastoral eclogues, the foundation of Spanish secular drama. Encina's plays are predominantly based on shepherds and unrequited love."

 opera_musica.EVTDESC4: "Josquin de Prez was the most famous European composer between Guillaume Dufay and Palestrina, and is usually considered to be the central figure of the Franco-Flemish School. Josquin is widely considered by music scholars to be the first master of the high Renaissance style of polyphonic vocal music that was emerging during his lifetime. During the 16th century, Josquin gradually acquired the reputation as the greatest composer of the age, his mastery of technique and expression universally imitated and admired. Writers as diverse as Baldassare Castiglione and Martin Luther wrote about his reputation and fame; theorists such as Heinrich Glarean and Gioseffo Zarlino held his style as that best representing perfection. Yet in spite of Josquin's colossal reputation, which endured until the beginning of the Baroque era and was revived in the 20th century, his biography is shadowy, and next to nothing is known about his personality. The only surviving work which may be in his own hand is a graffito on the wall of the Sistine Chapel, and only one contemporary mention of his character is known, in a letter to $MONARCH$. Josquin wrote both sacred and secular music, and in all of the significant vocal forms of the age, including masses, motets, chansons and frottole. During the 16th century, he was praised for both his supreme melodic gift and his use of ingenious technical devices."
 opera_musica.EVTNAME5: "Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina"
 opera_musica.EVTDESC5: "Palestrina was an Italian Renaissance composer of sacred music and the best-known 16th-century representative of the Roman School of musical composition. He has had a lasting influence on the development of church music, and his work has often been seen as the culmination of Renaissance polyphony. Palestrina left hundreds of compositions, including 105 masses, 68 offertories, at least 140 madrigals and more than 300 motets. In addition, there are at least 72 hymns, 35 magnificats, 11 litanies, and four or five sets of lamentations. One of the hallmarks of Palestrina's music is that dissonances are typically relegated to the 'weak' beats in a measure. This produced a smoother and more consonant type of polyphony which are now consider to be definitive of late Renaissance music, given Palestrina's position as Europe's leading composer (along with Lassus) in the wake of Josquin. The 'Palestrina style' now serves as a basis for college Renaissance counterpoint classes, thanks in large part to the efforts of the 18th-century composer and theorist Johann Joseph Fux, who, in a book called Gradus ad Parnassum (Steps to Parnassus, 1725), set about codifying Palestrina's techniques as a pedagogical tool for students of composition. Palestrina was famous in his day, and if anything his reputation increased after his death."
 opera_musica.EVTNAME6: "Mateo Flecha"
 opera_musica.EVTDESC6: "Mateo Flecha was a composer born in Catalonia, in the region of Prades. He is sometimes known as 'El Viejo' (the elder) to distinguish him from his nephew, Mateo Flecha 'El Joven' (the younger), also a composer of madrigals. 'El Viejo' is best known for his ensaladas, published by the same nephew. Mateo Flecha directed the music at the cathedral of Lleida (September 1523 – October 1525). From there he moved to Guadalajara, in the service for six years of the Duke, Diego Hurtado de Mendoza. From there he went to Valencia where he assumed direction of the chapel choir of the Duke of Calabria. While thus employed, three of his works were included in songbooks associated with that chapel, including the Cancionero de Uppsala (Falala... you know what I mean, eh?). Flecha is best known as composer of the 'ensalada' (literally 'salad'), a work for four or five voices written for the diversion of courtiers in the palace. The ensalada frequently mixed languages: Spanish, Catalan, Italian, French, and Latin. In addition to the ensalada, Flecha is known for his villancicos, or Christmas carols. Various Spanish vihuelists, like Enríquez de Valderrábano, Diego Pisador, and Miguel de Fuenllana, adapted Flecha's works for the vihuela."

 opera_musica.EVTDESC7: "Diego Ortiz was a Spanish composer and musicologist, in service to the King of Spain. Ortiz published influential treatises on both instrumental and vocal performance. Ortiz published two music books: Trattado de Glosas in 1553 and Musices liber primus in 1565. The Trattado de Glosas (modern Spanish spelling Tratado de Glosas) is considered a masterpiece of literature for the viola da gamba. The work was published on 10 December 1553, in Rome under the Spanish title Trattado de glossas sobre clausulas y otros generos de punctos en la musica de violones nuevamente puestos en luz. Its Italian title is Glose sopra le cadenze et altre sorte de punti in la musica del violone. Ortiz published a collection of polyphonic religious music in 1565 in Venice. Musices liber primus hymnos, Magnificas, Salves, motecta, psalmos includes sixty-nine compositions for four to seven voices, based on plainchant works."

 opera_musica.EVTDESC8: "Orlandus Lassus (also: Orlando di Lasso or Roland de Lattre) He is today considered to be the chief representative of the mature polyphonic style of the Franco-Flemish school, and one of the three most famous and influential musicians in Europe at the end of the 16th century (the other two being Palestrina and Victoria). Lassus was born in Mons in the County of Hainaut. At the age of twelve, he left the Low Countries and went to Mantua, Sicily, and later Milan (from 1547 to 1549). While in Milan, he made the acquaintance of the madrigalist Spirito l'Hoste da Reggio, a formative influence on his early musical style. He then worked as a singer and a composer in Naples in the early 1550s, and his first works are presumed to date from this time. Next he moved to Rome, where he became maestro di cappella of the Basilica di San Giovanni in Laterano. In 1556 he joined the court of $MONARCH$ who was consciously attempting to create a musical establishment on a par with the major courts in Italy. Lassus was one of several Netherlanders to work there, and by far the most famous. He evidently was happy in Munich and decided to settle there. By the 1560s Lassus had become quite famous, and composers began to go to Munich to study with him. The Pope knighted, the King of France invited, the Emperor visited him. One of the most prolific, versatile, and universal composers of the late Renaissance, Lassus wrote over 2,000 works in all Latin, French, Italian and German vocal genres known in his time. These include 530 motets, 175 Italian madrigals and villanellas, 150 French chansons, and 90 German lieder."
 opera_musica.EVTNAME9: "Antonio Valente"
 opera_musica.EVTDESC9: "Antonio Valente was an Italian Renaissance organist and composer. He was blind from childhood and served as organist of Sant'Angelo a Nilo in Naples in 1565–80. During that time he published two collections of organ music: Intavolatura de cimbalo (1 fantasia, 6 ricercares, Salve regina, 3 intabulations, 6 sets of variations, and 3 dances; 1575) and Versi spirituali (43 versets; 1580). Valente's second collection is historically important as one of the earliest instances of liturgical music free from any ties with the chant. Versi spirituali provides a wealth of diverse, freely composed pieces that cover the entire liturgy—the Mass and the Daily Offices. Valente's 1575 print, although of considerably lower quality, is also a major landmark in the history of Italian keyboard music, for together with Rocco Rodio's Libro di ricercate (1575) it constitutes the earliest work of the so-called Neapolitan school, which later produced composers such as Ascanio Mayone and Giovanni Maria Trabaci."
 opera_musica.EVTNAME10: "Gasparo da Salò"
 opera_musica.EVTDESC10: "Gasparo di Bertolotti was one of the earliest violin makers and an expert double bass player. Around 80 of his instruments are still in existence: violins (small and large), alto and tenor violas, viols, violones and double basses, violas with only a pair of corners, ceteras. He was born in Salò on Lake Garda, in a family with legal, artistic, musical and craft interests. When his father died, around 1562, he moved to Brescia. It appears Gasparo immediately rented a house and set up shop in the neighborhood hub of musical life, the Contrada Antegnati, known for the presence of a very famous dynasty of organ builders and other skilled multi-instrumentalists, from 1528 granted from the Brescia City Council, with a professional patent (first example in Europe), all of whom were located in the Second Quadra St. John, in front of the Palazzo Vecchio del Podestà (now Via Cairoli). Gasparo developed the art of string making to a very high level, and passed on this tradition to five known students. In 1575 he bought a house in the Cossere district, his historic headquarters, and subsequently manufactured many instruments. His workshop quickly became one of the most important in Europe in the second half of the 16th century for the production of every type of stringed instrument of the time. Until today, Gasparo is considered the inventor of the modern violin."
 opera_musica.EVTNAME11: "William Byrd"
 opera_musica.EVTDESC11: "William Byrd was an English composer of the Renaissance. He wrote in many of the forms current in England at the time, including various types of sacred and secular polyphony, keyboard (the so-called Virginalist school) and consort music. Byrd's output of about 470 compositions amply justifies his reputation as one of the great masters of European Renaissance music. Perhaps his most impressive achievement as a composer was his ability to transform so many of the main musical forms of his day and stamp them with his own identity. Having grown up in an age in which Latin polyphony was largely confined to liturgical items for the Sarum rite, he assimilated and mastered the Continental motet form of his day, employing a highly personal synthesis of English and continental models. He virtually created the Tudor consort and keyboard fantasia, having only the most primitive models to follow. He also raised the consort song, the church anthem and the Anglican service setting to new heights. Finally, despite a general aversion to the madrigal, he succeeded in cultivating secular vocal music in an impressive variety of forms in his three sets of 1588, 1589 and 1611. Although Byrd had a major reputation in England during his lifetime, his music was in many respects curiously unimportant."
 opera_musica.EVTNAME12: "Claudio Monteverdi"
 opera_musica.EVTDESC12: "Claudio Giovanni Antonio Monteverdi was an Italian composer, gambist, singer and Roman Catholic priest. Monteverdi's work, often regarded as revolutionary, marked the transition from the Renaissance style of music to that of the Baroque period. He developed two individual styles of composition – the heritage of Renaissance polyphony and the new basso continuo technique of the Baroque. He was recognized as an innovative composer and enjoyed considerable fame in his lifetime. Monteverdi composed at least eighteen operas, but only L'Orfeo, Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria, L'incoronazione di Poppea, and the famous aria, Lamento, from his second opera L'Arianna have survived. From monody (with melodic lines, intelligible text and placid accompanying music), it was a logical step for Monteverdi to begin composing opera. In 1607, his first opera, L'Orfeo, premiered in Mantua. L'Orfeo was not the first opera, but it was the first mature opera, or one that realized all of its potential. It was normal at that time for composers to create works on demand for special occasions, and this piece was part of the celebrations of carnival. Until today, Monteverdi is considered one of the greatest composers of all time, having a major influence on European orchestral music as a whole."
 opera_musica.EVTNAME13: "Giovanni Gabrieli"
 opera_musica.EVTDESC13: "Gabrieli  was an Italian composer and organist. He was one of the most influential musicians of his time, and represents the culmination of the style of the Venetian School, at the time of the shift from Renaissance to Baroque idioms. He became principal organist at Saint Mark's Basilica in 1585, after Claudio Merulo left the post; following his uncle's death the following year he took the post of principal composer as well. Gabrieli's career rose further when he took the additional post of organist at the Scuola Grande di San Rocco, another post he retained for his entire life. San Rocco was the most prestigious and wealthy of all the Venetian confraternities, and second only to San Marco itself in splendor of its musical establishment. Some of the most renowned singers and instrumentalists in Italy performed there and a vivid description of its musical activity survives in the travel memoirs of the English writer Thomas Coryat. Much of his music was written specifically for that location, although he probably composed even more for San Marco. San Marco had a long tradition of musical excellence and Gabrieli's work there made him one of the most noted composers in Europe. The vogue that began with his influential volume Sacrae symphoniae (1597) was such that composers from all over Europe, especially from Germany, came to Venice to study. Evidently he also made his new pupils study the madrigals being written in Italy, so not only did they carry back the grand Venetian polychoral style to their home countries, but also the more intimate style of madrigals; Heinrich Schütz and others helped transport the transitional early Baroque music north to Germany, a trend that decisively affected subsequent music history. The productions of the German Baroque, culminating in the music of J.S. Bach, were founded on this strong tradition, which had its roots in Venice."
 opera_musica.EVTNAME14: "Tomás Luis de Victoria"
 opera_musica.EVTDESC14: "Tomás Luis de Victoria, sometimes Italianised as da Vittoria, was the most famous composer of the 16th century in Spain, and one of the most important composers of the Counter-Reformation, along with Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina and Orlando di Lasso. Victoria was not only a composer, but also an accomplished organist and singer as well as a Catholic priest. However, he preferred the life of a composer to that of a performer. He is sometimes known as the 'Spanish Palestrina' because he may have been taught by Palestrina. Victoria is one of the best-regarded composers of sacred music in the late Renaissance, a genre to which he devoted himself exclusively. Victoria’s music reflected his intricate personality. In his music, the passion of Spanish mysticism and religion is expressed. Victoria was praised by Padre Martini for his melodic phrases and his joyful inventions. Many commentators hear in his music a mystical intensity and direct emotional appeal, qualities considered by some to be lacking in the arguably more rhythmically and harmonically placid music of Palestrina. There are quite a few differences in their compositional styles, such as treatment of melody and quarter-note dissonances. Victoria was a master at overlapping and dividing choirs with multiple parts with a gradual decreasing of rhythmic distance throughout. Not only does Victoria incorporate intricate parts for the voices, but the organ is treated almost like a soloist in many of his choral pieces. His most famous work, and his masterpiece, was a Requiem Mass for $MONARCHTITLE$ $RANDOM_OLD_MONARCH$."
 opera_musica.EVTNAME15: "Bartomeu Càrceres"
 opera_musica.EVTDESC15: "Bartomeu Càrceres was a Catalan composer, notably of ensaladas. The sole verifiable biographical fact known about him is the record in 1546 of a payment of 72 ducats to him as 'carrier of the books' to the capella of the Duke of Calabria, Ferran d'Aragó. His salary was half that of the maestro de capilla, Juan de Cepa. Manuscript M1166-M1967 of the Biblioteca de Catalunya includes works by both Càrceres and Cepa. For example the villancico Soleta y verge, an adaptation of a secular song from the Cancionero de Upsala appears in a version for three voices by Càrceres and a variation developed from this for five voices with refrain by Cepa. However, even if many people don't know his name and work, he became extremely popular because of one particular song - a villancico - which would destroy minds and souls of Europa Universalis players in the 21th century."

 opera_musica.EVTDESC16: "Johann(es) Hieronymus Kapsberger was a German-Italian virtuoso performer and composer of the early Baroque period. A prolific and highly original composer, Kapsberger is chiefly remembered today for his lute, theorbo and chitarrone music, which was seminal in the development of these as solo instruments. At least six collections were published during his lifetime, two of which are currently lost. Kapsberger's writing is characterized, especially in toccatas, by spontaneous changes, sharp contrasts, unusual rhythmic groupings and, sometimes, passages that do not conform to the rules of counterpoint that were in use at the time. The vast majority of contemporary critics praised Kapsberger's compositional skill and innovations. Among them was Athanasius Kircher, who described Kapsberger as a 'superb genius' and attested that he has 'successfully penetrated the secrets of music.' Also, Kapsberger's toccatas may have influenced those of Girolamo Frescobaldi, much like French lute music would, some years later, influence Johann Jakob Froberger's suites."

He resided in Parma from 1604 until 1614, and later moved to Rome, and then back to his native Naples, where in 1647 he became meastro di cappella at the royal chapel. He combined Italian and Spanish traditions, especially developing dance music."

 opera_musica.EVTDESC18: "Marin Marais was a French composer and viol player. He studied composition with Jean-Baptiste Lully, often conducting his operas, and with master of the bass viol Monsieur de Sainte-Colombe for six months. He wrote five books of Pièces de viole for the instrument, generally suites with basso continuo. These were quite popular in the court, and for these he was remembered in later years as he who 'founded and firmly established the empire of the viol'. His other works include a book of Pièces en trio and four operas, Alcyone being noted for its tempest scene. Marais is credited with being one of the earliest composers of program music. His work 'The Bladder-Stone Operation', for viola da gamba and harpsichord, includes composer's annotations such as 'The patient is bound with silken cords' and 'He screameth.'"

 opera_musica.EVTNAME20: "Johann Pachelbel"
 opera_musica.EVTDESC20: "Johann Pachelbel was a German Baroque composer, organist and teacher, who brought the south German organ tradition to its peak. He composed a large body of sacred and secular music, and his contributions to the development of the chorale prelude and fugue have earned him a place among the most important composers of the middle Baroque era. Pachelbel's music enjoyed enormous popularity during his lifetime; he had many pupils and his music became a model for the composers of south and central Germany. Today, Pachelbel is best known for the Canon in D, as well as the Chaconne in F minor, the Toccata in E minor for organ, and the Hexachordum Apollinis, a set of keyboard variations. Pachelbel's music was influenced by southern German composers, such as Johann Jakob Froberger and Johann Kaspar Kerll, Italians such as Girolamo Frescobaldi and Alessandro Poglietti, French composers, and the composers of the Nuremberg tradition. He preferred a lucid, uncomplicated contrapuntal style that emphasized melodic and harmonic clarity. His music is less virtuosic and less adventurous harmonically than that of Dieterich Buxtehude, although, like Buxtehude, Pachelbel experimented with different ensembles and instrumental combinations in his chamber music and, most importantly, his vocal music, much of which features exceptionally rich instrumentation. Pachelbel explored many variation forms and associated techniques, which manifest themselves in various diverse pieces, from sacred concertos to harpsichord suites."

In $YEAR$, Poet and literary theorist $PHILOSOPHER$ published his theories on how contemporary poets could attain excellence by imitating poetry, and by being carefully attentive to the exact sounds of words, as well as their positioning within lines.

 jeu_paume.EVTDESC7: "The equipment is ready, and it's time to travel to $FROMCOUNTRY$. $MONARCH$ has prepared himself and played some matches against local elites to better his skills. Hopefully, we will see a fine and fair game."
 jeu_paume.EVTOPTA7: "Let's go"
 jeu_paume.EVTNAME8: "Jeu de Paume player arrives"
 jeu_paume.EVTDESC8: "The ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ arrived. Everyone awaits the coming tournament. $MONARCH$ welcomed him friendly, offering a special seat at the banquet."
 jeu_paume.EVTOPTA8: "They should feel like home."

 jeu_paume.EVTDESC9: "Monarch has finally arrived in $FROMCOUNTRY$. He was welcomed with every honor a host can offer his guest. The tournament will begin in the next days."
 jeu_paume.EVTOPTA9: "They are nice hosts."
 jeu_paume.EVTNAME10: "Jeu de Paume match begins"
 jeu_paume.EVTDESC10: "Jeu de Paume is played in several rounds, until a player makes a point. Winning a point after a long battle for the ball is much more prestigious, but it also costs energy. The winning player will 'take it all', the loser won't get anything in the end. Historically, there were several styles to play Jeu de Paume, correlating with the route a ball took or a symbolical association. Names like 'Giraffe' (high ball), 'Piqué' (smashing ball) and 'Bobble' (slow ball) were around, but these are only some names to determine an even wider row of techniques and styles. Well, names like 'Fart' aren't that nice, are they? However, a very skilled player who has the advantage to begin the game may also risk everything and make a decisive point in the first round."
 jeu_paume.EVTOPTA10: "Play a Giraffe"
 jeu_paume.EVTOPTB10: "Play a Piqué"
 jeu_paume.EVTOPTC10: "Play a Bobble"
 jeu_paume.EVTOPTD10: "Caesar aut nihil!"
 jeu_paume.EVTNAME11: "A Giraffe"
 jeu_paume.EVTDESC11: "The Giraffe was a ball played high, which forced a jump to reach it. Countering it with any other style than a Giraffe will make the played technique much more random; playing a Counter-Giraffe is more secure to ensure the own style on the other player, but also may result in an advantage for the rival."
 jeu_paume.EVTOPTA11: "Counter-Giraffe!"
 jeu_paume.EVTNAME12: "A Piqué"
 jeu_paume.EVTDESC12: "The Piqué was a smashing ball which needed fast reflects to reach it. Countering it with any other style than a Piqué will make the played technique much more random; playing a Counter-Piqué is more secure to ensure the own style on the other player, but also may result in an advantage for the rival."
 jeu_paume.EVTOPTB12: "Counter-Piqué!"
 jeu_paume.EVTNAME13: "A Bobble"
 jeu_paume.EVTDESC13: "The Boble was a slow ball but dangerous because it could reach the ground behind the net and would be very difficult to return after touching the ground. Countering it with any other style than a Bobble will make the played technique much more random; playing a Counter-Bobble is more secure to ensure the own style on the other player, but also may result in an advantage for the rival."
 jeu_paume.EVTOPTC13: "Counter-Bobble!"
 jeu_paume.EVTNAME14: "An opportunity"
 jeu_paume.EVTDESC14: "The last ball which our guest from $FROMCOUNTRY$ played wasn't that perfect after all. With some extra-energy, $MONARCH$ would be able to return a very dangerous ball, which may end in the defeat of the other player."
 jeu_paume.EVTOPTA14: "That's an opportunity!"
 jeu_paume.EVTOPTB14: "Play a normal ball"
 jeu_paume.EVTNAME15: "An uncatchable ball?"
 jeu_paume.EVTDESC15: "There is a heated discussion about the last point the ruler from [From.GetName] made. [From.Monarch.GetSheHeCap] claims that [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] last ball was uncatchable and [Root.Monarch.GetName] wasn't able to catch it before it left the field. In contrary, [Root.Monarch.GetName] claims that this ball was out. The foreign ruler made the compromise to replay the round, but [Root.Monarch.GetName] insisted that the ball was out and [Root.Monarch.GetSheHe] had won the match... even if that isn't true after all."
 jeu_paume.EVTOPTA15: "I insist! This ball was out!"
 jeu_paume.EVTNAME16: "A chase"
 jeu_paume.EVTDESC16: "In Jeu de Paume, a chase was the option to replay a round, battling once again for a point. It opened the possibility for the attacker to begin from a new and fresh base to gain ground."
 jeu_paume.EVTNAME17: "Equal return"
 jeu_paume.EVTDESC17: "Sometimes, friendship and fair play had a higher value in a match of Jeu de Paume than the game itself. If a monarch likes the other, heated discussions over some rules weren't part of the game. In this case, the noble spirit of $MONARCH$ gained the upper hand. A ball which was played by the ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ was very weak. The $MONARCHTITLE$ had the opportunity to let his rival win and better the relations with him, which would be seen as a noble gesture. However, by doing so, he would lose the match."
 jeu_paume.EVTOPTA17: "I'll be noble"
 jeu_paume.EVTNAME18: "No chance"
 jeu_paume.EVTDESC18: "The ruler from $FROMCOUNTRY$ is a skilled and dangerous player. $MONARCH$ had no chance, the last ball was uncatchable and decided the match. Unfortunately, the $MONARCHTITLE$ has lost this match of Jeu de Paume."
 jeu_paume.EVTOPTA18: "I've lost..."
 jeu_paume.EVTNAME19: "A giant fail"
 jeu_paume.EVTDESC19: "The rival player has overestimated his abilities in the last round. The ball he played gave $MONARCH$ the chance to play an uncatchable ball, which the ruler from $FROMCOUNTRY$ won't be able to get. This match is decided. Our $MONARCHTITLE$ has won!"
 jeu_paume.EVTOPTA19: "Tenez!"
 jeu_paume.EVTNAME20: "Jeu de Paume player is chivalrous"
 jeu_paume.EVTDESC20: "Our rival player at the Jeu de Paume game has a noble spirit. He played the ball so, that $MONARCH$ may keep his face after a misguided ball and can win the whole game. The ruler of $FROMCOUNTRY$ seems to be a nice person."
 jeu_paume.EVTOPTA20: "A fair player, indeed!"
 jeu_paume.EVTNAME21: "Jeu de Paume player is a cheater!"
 jeu_paume.EVTDESC21: "Our rival player at the Jeu de Paume claims that our last ball went out, even if that isn't true. He claims to have won the game and cheated us. That's an outstanding insult!"
 jeu_paume.EVTOPTA21: "What a betrayal!"
 jeu_paume.EVTNAME22: "Jeu de Paume match ends"
 jeu_paume.EVTDESC22: "The match is over, and the guest travels back to his country, whereas the host has given order to end the festivities. It was a great tournament - well, a better one for the winner, but also a good opportunity to show the abilities of the elite. It will remain in memory for quite a while."
 jeu_paume.EVTOPTA22: "We should do this again!"
 jeu_paume.EVTOPTA23: "No Jeu de Paume for me for a while..."
 jeu_paume.EVTNAME24: "Local tournament begins"
 jeu_paume.EVTDESC24: "The great day has come. Nobles across the country have travelled to $CAPITAL_CITY$ to play against each other. The great event was highly anticipated, and now, $MONARCH$ has officially opened the Jeu de Paume season for this year."

 jeu_paume.EVTNAME25: "Local tournament ends"
 jeu_paume.EVTDESC25: "The tournament in $CAPITAL_CITY$ has come to an end. The nobility has enjoyed the days of communication and play. It will remembered as one of the finest events in the last and coming years."
 jeu_paume.EVTOPTA25: "We should do this again!"
 jeu_paume.EVTNAME26: "Revolutionaries use Jeu de Paume hall in $CAPITAL_CITY$"
 jeu_paume.EVTDESC26: "The Jeu de Paume hall of of $CAPITAL_CITY$ has become a major center for revolutionary assemblies. There are rumours about a new constitution. The members of the revolutionary committee took a solemn collective oath 'not to separate, and to reassemble wherever circumstances require, until the constitution of the kingdom is established'. In the course of the revolution, it would become famous as the 'Tennis Court Oath'."
 jeu_paume.EVTOPTA26: "That's a place to play, not to debate!"

 architecture.EVTDESC0: "After years of investments, efforts, costs and work, $CAPITAL_CITY$ looks better than ever. New buildings, new places, new fountains and gardens mark the street, everything in the newest style. The infrastructure has a new standard, and even the streets seem cleaner than before. $CAPITAL_CITY$, you are a Lady!"
 architecture.EVTOPTA0: "This is a glorious day!"
 architecture.EVTNAME1: "Construction begins"
 architecture.EVTDESC1: "$ARCHITECT$ and $MONARCH$ had a long talk together, planning new streets and building in $CAPITAL_CITY$. There is much to do. The work may take years, or dozen of years if we want to accomplish everything we had in mind. Some persons in the government think that these plans are a waste of money, and that such a big project may see delays and other problems. What happens if $ARCHITECT$ can't finish his projects? What may happen, if we don't have any material left to finish everything? The $MONARCHTITLE$ tried to calm down the critics; however, even $MONARCH$ is not so sure if he may see the end of these constructions, and maybe even his successors won't see it."
 architecture.EVTOPTA1: "A bit more optimism, please!"
 architecture.EVTNAME2: "Renaissance Marketplace"
 architecture.EVTDESC2: "When inspecting the building site, $ARCHITECT$ noticed that our marketplace needed some special flair. He proposed some adorable fountains, a nice loggia, and also some columns. Many columns. There would be a new trading place for our merchants and, certainly, a statue of $MONARCH$ in the center."
 architecture.EVTOPTA2: "A Statue? Of course!"
 architecture.EVTOPTB2: "I shudder to think of what the birds might do..."
 architecture.EVTNAME3: "Baroque Church"
 architecture.EVTDESC3: "$ARCHITECT$ visited our main church in $CAPITAL_CITY$. He was a bit disappointed, because he found the style more or less outdated. He wrote a letter to $MONARCH$ and proposed that we should give the church a new baroque interior."
 architecture.EVTOPTA3: "We certainly need more putti in the capital"
 architecture.EVTOPTB3: "Putti? In MY $CAPITAL_CITY$?"
 architecture.EVTNAME4: "Rokoko Alleys"
 architecture.EVTDESC4: "$ARCHITECT$ lamented that the streets of $CAPITAL_CITY$ are too narrow. When visiting $MONARCH$, he suggested that we should reshape the entire city, building wider roads and alleys with trees. When our $MONARCHTITLE$ gave a skeptical answer, $ARCHITECT$ replied, that 'the $PRIMARY_CULTURE$ soldier likes to march in the shadow.'"
 architecture.EVTOPTA4: "He has a point"
 architecture.EVTOPTB4: "We shouldn't destroy our heritage"
 architecture.EVTNAME5: "Classical Courthouse"
 architecture.EVTDESC5: "The courthouse of $CAPITAL_CITY$ has a long history and tradition. However, $ARCHITECT$ proposed that we should modernize it and even made plans for a new façade. It's up to $MONARCH$ to decide if that project should be realized."
 architecture.EVTOPTA5: "Classicism rules the world"
 architecture.EVTOPTB5: "I like the old style. It's good to hear squeaking windows in the morning"
 architecture.EVTNAME6: "Corruption"
 architecture.EVTDESC6: "There are some problems regarding $CAPITAL_CITY$. The major building efforts are hampered by vanishing materials. Absent supervisors. And we've even heard that a foreign power bribed some workers to abandon $COUNTRY$ and make our work useless. Without an architect, corruption has gathered the upper hand at the building sides."
 architecture.EVTOPTA6: "We need to do something against this"
 architecture.EVTOPTB6: "It's not necessary"
 architecture.EVTNAME7: "Strike in $CAPITAL_CITY$!"
 architecture.EVTDESC7: "Worrisome things are ongoing in our capital. It started at the new theatre, where some workers didn't get a salary for months. Then, the uproar spread to other places. The mob banded together and protested against the working conditions and outstanding food and other problems. Without an architect, who may control or end the situation, or could at least ensure that such problems wouldn't arise, the situation at the building site erupted into a major strike."
 architecture.EVTOPTA7: "Raise the salaries"
 architecture.EVTNAME8: "Material shortages"
 architecture.EVTDESC8: "For weeks, the good workers in $CAPITAL_CITY$ await new stones, wood and other materials for the modernization of our city. They wait, and wait - and wait. That's not the first time. In fact, without an architect, we don't even know how many times we had problems with the delivery of such goods. However, putting an end to these problems is crucial if $CAPITAL_CITY$ shouldn't stay a ruin for centuries."
 architecture.EVTOPTA8: "Buy new materials"
 architecture.EVTNAME9: "No plan"
 architecture.EVTDESC9: "When our architect left the building project in $CAPITAL_CITY$, our building plans vanished too. That's a problem. A severe problem. Nothing is moving anymore regarding our building efforts. Workers have had to stop their work. The situation is severe."
 architecture.EVTOPTA9: "We must search for them!"
 architecture.EVTNAME10: "The Palazzo of $PROVINCENAME$"
 architecture.EVTDESC10: "Our architect is not only active when it comes to official matters. When travelling in the countryside, a local noble from $PROVINCECAPITAL$ wanted to have a talk with him. He heard from $ARCHITECT$ and his abilities, and employed him for some time to build a new Renaissance Palazzo in his home province. This building is an outstanding example of modern architecture, and has become one of the finest buildings in whole $PROVINCENAME$. The remarkable work was praised in foreign lands. $MONARCH$ was invited for the grand opening, and some say, that this place may become a future, second residence for our $MONARCHTITLE$s."
 architecture.EVTOPTA10: "I really like that place"
 architecture.EVTNAME11: "The Fine Gardens of $PROVINCECAPITAL$"
 architecture.EVTDESC11: "$ARCHITECT$ has shown great skill. The council of $PROVINCECAPITAL$ gave him the task to create a public baroque garden, which has become one of the finest places in $COUNTRY$. It is admired in our entire country, and the elite praises the park even in foreign lands."
 architecture.EVTNAME12: "An Ideal City in $PROVINCENAME$"
 architecture.EVTDESC12: "Our age has seen a development in city infrastructure and architecture. New times need new approaches. The governor of $PROVINCENAME$ has founded a completely new city in these lands, build on the principles of our time. This is a giant step in cultural evolution, and a symbol for our prosperous country. $ARCHITECT$ was the planner and architect of this enormous project, and $MONARCH$ congratulated him for this outstanding work."
 architecture.EVTNAME13: "The Museum of $PROVINCECAPITAL$"
 architecture.EVTDESC13: "A new time has begun. Interest in science, progress and education is not only a privilege of the elite, but has become a part of daily life for wider classes. The burghers of $PROVINCECAPITAL$ have collected money to invest in a museum and hire $ARCHITECT$, who is famous for his work. Now, a museum is the new sign of $PROVINCENAME$, build in the newest style of Classicism."
 architecture.EVTNAME14: "Project cancelled in $PROVINCENAME$"
 architecture.EVTDESC14: "The modernizing process in $PROVINCECAPITAL$ were cancelled today. As this city has lost its function as a capital, no one has any interest to finish this project. There are only some unfinished ruins left."
 architecture.EVTOPTA14: "Well, hopefully we can sell some of the building materials..."
 architecture.EVTNAME15: "Donato Bramante"
 architecture.EVTDESC15: "Originally born near Urbino, Donato di Pascuccio d'Antonio - later knowns as Donato Bramante - moved to Milan in $YEAR$. Until then, the Lombard capital was highly influenced by Gothic architectural tradition, but Bramante would introduce the new Renaissance style to the city. Historically, the Duke made him virtually his court architect, beginning in 1476, with commissions that culminated in the famous trompe-l'oeil choir of the church of Santa Maria presso San Satiro (1482–1486). Space was limited, and Bramante made a theatrical apse in bas-relief, combining the painterly arts of perspective with Roman details. He also built the tribune of Santa Maria delle Grazie, the place where Leonardo painted the 'Last supper'. When Milan was conquered by the French in 1499, Bramente decided to move to Rome, where he would convince Julius II to rebuild St Peter's Basilica. Really, a great man of the Renaissance..."
 architecture.EVTOPTA15: "Magnificent!"
 architecture.EVTNAME16: "Andrea Palladio"
 architecture.EVTDESC16: "Palladio, influenced by Roman and Greek architecture, primarily by Vitruvius, is widely considered the most influential individual in the history of Western architecture. All of his buildings are located in what was the Venetian Republic, but his teachings, summarized in the architectural treatise, The Four Books of Architecture, gained him wide recognition. He designed many palaces, villas, and churches, but Palladio's reputation, initially, and after his death, has been founded on his skill as a designer of villas. The palladian villas are located mainly in the province of Vicenza, while the palazzi are concentrated in the city of Vicenza and the churches in Venice. A number of his works are now protected as part of the World Heritage Site City of Vicenza and the Palladian Villas of the Veneto. Other buildings by Palladio are to be found within the Venice and its Lagoon World Heritage Site. Palladio's first major public project began when his designs for building the loggias for the town hall, known as the Basilica Palladiana, were approved in 1548. He proposed an addition of two-storey stone buttresses reflecting the Gothic style of the existing hall while using classical proportions. The construction was completed in 1617 after Palladio's death."
 architecture.EVTNAME17: "Juan de Herrera"
 architecture.EVTDESC17: "One of the most outstanding Spanish architects in the 16th century, Herrera represents the peak of the Renaissance in Spain. His sober style was fully developed in buildings like the Monastery of San Lorenzo de El Escorial. The Herrerian style was named after him, and was representative of the architecture of $MONARCH$ and his successors. As a Renaissance man, Herrera was interested in all the branches of knowledge of his times. His Discurso sobre la figura cúbica (Discussion of the Cubic form) tells us about his notable knowledge about geometry and mathematics. In 1563 he starts his collaborations with Juan Bautista de Toledo in the construction of El Escorial. In 1562 he had written the Book of the Astronomical knowledge (Libro del saber de astronomía). After the death of Juan Bautista de Toledo in 1567, Herrera becomes the director architect of the works. Herrera modifies the plans and enlarges the program, changing the image of the façades and introducing his personal sober style."
 architecture.EVTNAME18: "Francois Mansart"
 architecture.EVTDESC18: "Francois Mansart was a French architect credited with introducing classicism into Baroque architecture of France. Mansart, as he is generally known, made extensive use of a four-sided, double slope gambrel roof punctuated with windows on the steeper lower slope, creating additional habitable space in the garrets that ultimately became named for him – the mansard roof. Mansart was highly recognized since the 1620s for his style and skill as an architect, but he was viewed as a stubborn and difficult perfectionist, tearing down his structures in order to start building them over again. Only the richest could afford to have him work for them, as Mansart's constructions cost 'more money than the Great Turk himself possesses'."
 architecture.EVTNAME19: "Balthasar Neumann"
 architecture.EVTDESC19: "Balthasar Neumann was a German military artillery engineer and architect who developed a refined brand of Baroque architecture, fusing Austrian, Bohemian, Italian, and French elements to design some of the most impressive buildings of the period, including the Würzburg Residence and the Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers, called Vierzehnheiligen in German. In 1715, Neumann had already emerged as a rising talent and come to the notice of the Elector of Mainz. After a period of time under the direction of the Würzburg architect Andreas Müller and Joseph Greising, in 1719, the newly appointed Prince-Bishop of Würzburgappointed Neumann the chief engineer in Würzburg. Neumann took this position in 1720 after all the planning for the construction of the Würzburg Residence, which is considered one of the most beautiful and well proportioned palaces in Europe. Neuman was one of the most influential and famous architects of Germany and was honoured in the 20th century when a picture of him could be seen on the 50-DM note."
 architecture.EVTNAME20: "Robert Adam"
 architecture.EVTDESC20: "Robert Adam was a leader of the first phase of the classical revival in England and Scotland from around 1760 until his death. He was the son of William Adam, the country's foremost architect of the time, and trained under him. With his older brother John, Robert took on the family business, which included lucrative work for the Board of Ordnance, after William's death. In 1754 he left for Rome, spending nearly five years on the continent studying architecture under Charles-Louis Clérisseau and Giovanni Battista Piranesi. On his return to Britain he established a practice in London, where he was joined by his younger brother James. Here he developed the 'Adam Style', and his theory of 'movement' in architecture, based on his studies of antiquity and became one of the most successful and fashionable architects in the country. Adam held the post of Architect of the King's Works from 1761 to 1769."

 festa_carnival.EVTNAME3: "Narrenbischof"
 festa_carnival.EVTDESC3: "One of the more vulgar traditions in a carnival was that of a 'Narrenbischof'. This tradition included some imbecile or a child to be sitting on donkey and be called the bishop. Sometimes  the donkey himself would function as bishop, much to the merriment of the peasants and the anger of the clergy."

 festa_carnival.EVTNAME4: "Svolo del Turco"
 festa_carnival.EVTDESC4: "The Flight of the Turk is an event usually held on Shrove Thursday of Carnival (grasso) this has its roots due to an event that happened in the mid 16th century. In those years, during various exhibitions, a Turkish acrobat did something that stupefied the Venetians. With the only aid of a pole he walked on a rope from a boat tied in Riva degli Schiavoni to the top of St Mark’s Tower and then from the tower to the Doge’s Palace balcony, as a tribute to the doge. From that on, the attraction became an important element of Venetian tradition in Carnival days. However, sometimes the acrobat didn't show the same talent like his colleague in the last year, and even tragedies could happen."

 festa_carnival.EVTOPTC6: "Let me try his strength myself"
 festa_carnival.EVTNAME7: "Masquerade"
 festa_carnival.EVTDESC7: "A very important part of the carnival was dressing up with costumes and masks. Of course it would give some notorious scallywags the chance to do  their mischief without being recognized. If we would ban masks we had better control over the streets, but then again everybody would be upset."
 festa_carnival.EVTOPTA7: "Allow masks"
 festa_carnival.EVTOPTB7: "Ban them"
 festa_carnival.EVTNAME8: "Gambling"

 festa_carnival.EVTOPTB8: "Betting is a sin"
 festa_carnival.EVTNAME9: "Vanity laws"
 festa_carnival.EVTDESC9: "The carnival was not only a fun time for the peasants but for the richer people as well. Many of them arrange private festivities, which are getting more and more excessive. Others show their wealth with elaborate costume and a lot of gold and jewellery. Maybe we should restrict this development with a new set of laws."

 festa_carnival.EVTNAME10: "Feast of the Ass"
 festa_carnival.EVTDESC10: "Maybe the most excessive form of the peasant's carnival was the feast of the ass, where a donkey played the roll of a priest during a mass and all the sermons held preached promiscuity and other sins.

 festa_carnival.EVTNAME18: "Burning the scapegoat"
 festa_carnival.EVTDESC18: "In many regions of Europe, especially in the Rhineland and bordering regions, people used to burn a puppet at the end of the carnival. This puppet was a scapegoat for all the sins which happened in these days. Traditions varied from region to region, but normally, it was a sign to wash his own hands free from sins and giving the responsibility to another force."

 si_generic.EVTDESC4: "When the Italian peninsula became more and more united under our rule, the question of our capital arose. As our nation is focused on this geographic region, we should have a splendid, representative capital which will show the greatness of our nations. However, the advisors of $MONARCH$ had different opinions. The first faction argued, that Pavia, the old capital of the Kingdom of Italy, the home of the Lombard and National Kings, should be once again the center of Italy to show our claim and historical connection to the Kings of the Middle Ages. Others proposed Rome, the glorious capital of the old Empire, once center of the world, home of our grandfathers, which shaped Italy and the whole Mediterranean. A third faction recommended Florence for various reasons. First, because it was the heart of the Renaissance, the center where Italian history and culture began to blossom. Also, Florence is the home of Dante Alighieri, the greatest poet after Antiquity, and father of the modern Italian language, and a symbol of Italian unity. It is also possible to expand our existing capital, like some proposed. The $MONARCHTITLE$ has the final word, but if he decides to move or expand the capital, this will be as prestigious as costly. It will also be important to hire an architect to ensure city development. So, which place should we chose?"

 local_italian_power: "Local Italian Power"
 desc_local_italian_power: "The Italian peninsula is divided in five different types of powers: local, regional, major, dominant and menacing ones. The first two gain economical advantages, major powers have a diplomatic bonus, whereas the last two have disadvantages in both areas. The power level is based mainly on the number and the value of owned provinces in the Italian region. High base tax, a Center of Trade, high local manpower, a unique building and an important city (Rome, Florence, Naples, Milan, Venice) have a considerable effect on the value of a province. The amount and size of vassals or unions and available national manpower are also taken in consideration. Being a vassal or the lesser partner of an union destroys the power of an Italian state. Major and Dominant powers have special options in a possible Italic League. All powers will oppose Dominant and Menacing powers, especially the latter ones. Expansion in Italian territory may have a big effect in the fragile system of Italian balance. The power status is checked each year, so it may take some months until a change will be notified."

 italian_power.EVTNAME1: "The Italian Balance"
 italian_power.EVTDESC1: "During this era, the Italian peninsula was dominated by the factor of balance. This meant that preserving the status quo was the highest rule; no Italian power should have once again a hegemony like the Visconti of Milan had in the century prior. Florence and Venice made an alliance to break the heritage of the Visconti, which lead to a fragmented, though arguably more balanced peninsula, in which the five powers of the 'Italian Pentarchy' (Milan, Venice, Florence, Naples, and the Papacy) ruled the game of power. Later, when the Italian League was formed, it were these powers which preserved peace and prosperity in Italian lands, leading to the Renaissance - a cultural and a technological springtime for the whole of Europe. It is not clear if the Italian countries will overcome their differences to keep the realm unmolested by its eager neighbors. After all, skepticism is high between the Italian nations, and every territorial expansion in the region will be observed with the great fear that, once again, one power may come to dominate the rest.\n\nVenice especially is feared, and will have a difficult journey expanding past its borders on the peninsula.\n\nFlorence has its own internal strife, due to the ruling Medici family vying to achieve full power in the republic.\n\nIn Naples, the reign of a bastard King marks a new age for Southern Italy, but the House of Anjou desires the reclamation of their lands.\n\nMilan, once the most important power in Italy, struggles to fight a wane into obscurity.\n\nAnd the Pope, in an effort to strengthen the dejure borders of the donation of Constantine, must work to consolidate his vassals for the betterment of the realm.\n\nEvery move in this game of chess will have consequences. An Italian power must be prepared... force alone is not the way to rule as a true Prince."
