 tjl_aristocrats.40000.t: "In Love With a Rival's Daughter"
 tjl_aristocrats.40000.d: "My $MONARCHTITLE$, we have learned that one of your most powerful Nobles has been caught in a love affair with the daughter of one of our enemy's Nobles. Were this but just a one night stand or a brief dalliance, I would not concern the $MONARCHTITLE$, however; this looks to be a very serious affair and could lead to dire consequences if it is not handled quickly and discretely. Whispers even suggest that this Noble could attempt to separate from $COUNTRY$ and side with our enemy.\n\nMy $MONARCHTITLE$, how shall we proceed in the delicate matter?"
 tjl_aristocrats.40000.opta: "Send an emissary to talk to the Noble."
 tjl_aristocrats.40000.optb: "Arrest the Noble!"
 tjl_aristocrats.40000.optc: "Send an assassin to remove the rival's daughter."
 tjl_aristocrats.40001.t: "In Love With a Rival's Daughter, Act II"
 tjl_aristocrats.40001.d: "My $MONARCHTITLE$, do you remember about a year ago one of our powerful Nobles was romantically involved with the daughter of one of our enemy's? I must report that there has been little change and, if anything, he has become even more involved than before. In fact, there are rumors that he is prepared to propose to her and separate from $COUNTRY$. I am at a bit of a loss to advise on a safe path.\n\nWhat do you wish to do?"
 tjl_aristocrats.40001.opta: "Bring the Noble to me."
 tjl_aristocrats.40001.optb: "Throw the Noble in the dungeon, and do not speak to me of this again!"
 tjl_aristocrats.40001.optc: "Send an assassin to remove the rival's daughter."
 tjl_aristocrats.40001.optd: "To War!!!"
 tjl_aristocrats.40002.t: "In Love With a Rival's Daughter, Act II"
 tjl_aristocrats.40002.d: "My $MONARCHTITLE$, do you remember about a year or two ago one of our powerful Nobles was romantically involved with the daughter of one of our enemies, so we had him arrested? During his absence unrest has continued to grow and revenue from his province has dwindled to near nothing.  The situation is spreading to neighboring provinces and we are beginning to see revenues dwindle there as well. We must do something before this gets entirely out of hand."
 tjl_aristocrats.40002.opta: "Send the Noble back with instructions that no contact with our enemy will be permitted."
 tjl_aristocrats.40002.optb: "I am the Master of this realm and the people must come to know it. Crush them!"
 tjl_aristocrats.40002.optc: "Send an assassin to remove the rival's daughter. Then turn the Noble loose."
 tjl_aristocrats.40003.t: "In Love With a Rival's Daughter, Act III"
 tjl_aristocrats.40003.d: "My $MONARCHTITLE$, that powerful Noble who was romantically involved with the daughter of one of our enemy's is at it again. He has been seen in the capital of our enemy openly involved with this, this, ... woman.\n\nWe must put an end to this before something serious happens."
 tjl_aristocrats.40003.opta: "Arrange a Marriage with this trollop. How could he stoop so low?"
 tjl_aristocrats.40003.optb: "Let the people know who their Master is. Send in the army!!!"
 tjl_aristocrats.40004.t: "In Love With a Rival's Daughter, Act III"
 tjl_aristocrats.40004.d: "My $MONARCHTITLE$, that powerful Noble who was romantically involved with the daughter of one of our enemy's is at it again. I guess being tossed in the dungeon did not teach him much. He has been seen in the capital of our enemy openly involved with this, this, ... woman.\n\nWe must put an end to this before something serious happens."
 tjl_aristocrats.40004.opta: "Arrange a Marriage. He will pay."
 tjl_aristocrats.40004.optb: "Let the people know who their Master is. Send in the army!!!"
 tjl_aristocrats.40090.t: "Assassination War"
 tjl_aristocrats.40090.d: "My $MONARCHTITLE$, do you remember the assassination of our enemy's daughter who was involved with one our powerful Nobles? Apparently the assassination did not go undetected and our enemy has just declared war on us."
 tjl_aristocrats.40090.opta: "NOT NOW!"
 tjl_aristocrats.40091.t: "Assassination War"
 tjl_aristocrats.40091.d: "Die, you bastards."

 tjl_aristocrats.50000.t: "The Roads Are Unsafe to Travel"
 tjl_aristocrats.50000.d: "My $MONARCHTITLE$, our aristocrats are reporting bandits running unchecked on $COUNTRY$'s roadways. Produce, cattle, sheep, horses and travelers are disappearing, causing discontent in the provinces and greatly reducing income. We have known for somt time of the reluctance of the aristocracy to give up any power and authority, and install independent sheriffs in their regions. We can address the problem by allocating troops to patrol the roads, but the final answer is to build up the local police forces through sheriff's offices."
 tjl_aristocrats.50000.opta: "Send the troops"
 tjl_aristocrats.50000.optb: "We need to build up our provincial authorities"

 tjl_aristocrats.70000.t: "Nobles Revolting"
 tjl_aristocrats.70000.d: "My $MONARCHTITLE$, the Nobles have risen up in protest of your inept handling of our country's affairs.  We are the laughing stock of the world; our prestige is ... well, you are thought of as a joke, the legitimacy of your bloodline is in question, our country is unstable with turmoil everywhere and our army is in tatters. My $MONARCHTITLE$, they are calling for your head!"
 tjl_aristocrats.70000.opta: "Ingrates!"
 tjl_aristocrats.70001.t: "Noble Revolt Continues"
 tjl_aristocrats.70001.d: "The Nobles are gaining strength, my $MONARCHTITLE$.\n\nWe must quickly end this conflict before they become too strong.  We could also improve our Prestige to at least 0, our Legitimacy to 25 or our Stability to at least 1 to prevent further revolts and reinforcements. We should focus on controlling the highest Tax Base Provinces as these will generate larger revolts."
