 tjl_religious_events.1.t: "Conversion of $PROVINCENAME$"
 tjl_religious_events.1.d: "Our missionaries are at work in $PROVINCENAME$, and will eventually convert the people, but such mass conversions are often difficult. It might take a lot more work! Typically, religious minorities are restive, and eventually return to their original faith - oftentimes in secret.\n\n However, you can reduce the risk of their return to an old religion by having a core on the province, building administration buildings, and by spreading our culture."
 tjl_religious_events.1.opta: "God Bless Them!"

 tjl_religious_events.10000.t: "Religious Upheaval in $PROVINCENAME$"
 tjl_religious_events.10000.d: "Although our missionaries reported that the people of $PROVINCENAME$ had converted to $COUNTRY_RELIGION$, it appears that their efforts were less successful than stated. Our agents report signs of unrest and turmoil within the land and, though violence does not appear to be imminent, rebellion and full insurrection may eventually break out as tensions rise. It appears we have two options open to us, my $MONARCHTITLE$.\n\n1.) Allow the people to convert back to their original beliefs, or possibly to those of a neighboring province influential upon them. We will, of course, be able to apply further teachings in the future, possibly at a time of peace when we have the soldiers to control their unrest.\n\n2.) Continue to force our beliefs upon the populace. They will not like it, and we must be prepared for eventual rebellion. While our authority is still fresh in their minds, it would be ideal to place at least one regiment of infantry in the province to quell any unrest before it's too late. We can further reduce the risk by having a core on the province, building administration buildings, and by spreading our culture.\n\nHow would you like to proceed, my $MONARCHTITLE$?"
 tjl_religious_events.10000.opta: "Let the people choose their own religion."

 tjl_religious_events.10003.d: "At last, the people of $PROVINCENAME$ have accepted the true faith and fully converted to $COUNTRY_RELIGION$."
