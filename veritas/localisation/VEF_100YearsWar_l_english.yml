 vef_100war.1.t: "Tour De Nesle Affair"
 vef_100war.1.d: "Rumours began to surface in 1313 that the wives of Phillip's sons were engaged in adultery with certain knights of the realm and that these trysts were taking place within the Nesle Tower in Paris.  By 1314 formal accusations were being raised.  Certainly Louis' and Charles' marriages were not happy ones and the preponderance of evidence suggested their wives had indeed committed adultery. There was little evidence against the wife of Phillip's second son (also named Phillip).  The young Phillip was adamant of his wife's innocence and she was found thus by the Parliament of Paris.  The same parliament returned convictions for her two sisters-in-law."

 vef_100war.6.d: "While Salic Law bars a woman from the throne of France, the English monarchs are contesting that they may still inherit through a woman and are therefore rightful heirs to the Capetian dynasty. \n\nHistorically, Edward III pressed these claims following the death of Charles IV without a male heir.  The dispute, along with issues relating to the duchy of Aquitaine, ultimately led to the 100 Years War."
