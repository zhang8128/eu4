 vef_balticsea.10000.d: "From the 13th century until the middle of the 17th century the Hanseatic Trade League dominated much of the trade in the Baltic Sea with their combined commercial and military strength. The league was lead by a collection of Holy Roman Empire city states commonly known under the name of the Hansa, and their strong standing often forced weaker countries to relinquish control of key goods at important trade nodes to the Hanseatic merchants, increasing their influence even further. Even though considered part of the trade league, $COUNTRY$ and its Scandinavian neighbors often found themselves targets of the Hansa during the 14th and 15th century, with several wars as a result. Using their strong diplomatic connections the Hansa was able to call in many of the members of the Holy Roman Empire to aid them in the conflicts with the northern countries.\n\nOur merchants have in the last months noticed an increase in merchants from the actual Hansa city states, indicating an increased interest in the trade in our region. It is time for us to decide how to deal with them, but consider this carefully as it is a decision that can influence $COUNTRY$ for many years."

 vef_balticsea.10252.t: "The union is no more"
 vef_balticsea.10252.d: "With the war for independence won, the last lesser member of the Kalmar Union leaves, leaving it nothing but a fancy name on paper showing our folly."

 vef_balticsea.10300.d: "After a successful intelligence campaign we have managed to capture a large number of Swedish rebel leaders working for the independence of their country and are currently keeping them under guard at the city of Stockholm. This betrayal proves them as heathens going against the will of God and it is our duty to fulfill the laws of the Papal State by execution."

 vef_balticsea.10310.d: "It seems the recent executions we performed in the name of the Pope in Stockholm have led to a huge rebellion in Sweden led by Gustav Vasa. The by Swedish people titled king claims it was a unwarranted bloodbath showing what a tyrant $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ is.\n\nGustav Vasa's slander has already reached the rest of the wold and our reputation has been tarnished, just an excuse by him to declare an liberation war against us. Whatever the reasons it seems unlikely our grand Union will ever get restored."
