 vef_encyclopedia.101.d: "The main feature of the policy overhaul introduced in VeF 3.0 are the new focus groups.  The purpose of these groups is to shape one's nation, over time, in a way the ruler sees fit.  In total there are nine focus groups covering thirty-six possible policies.  The initial standard variants start becoming available at tech level 3.  Each specialization or finisher only requires one completed idea group to be unlocked.\n\nBasic Group Structure:\n\n   Standard Policy - 1 positive and 1 negative modifier.\n   Specialization alpha - 2 positive and 1 negative modifier.\n   Specialization beta - 2 positive and 1 negative modifier.\n   Finisher - 1 positive and 1 negative modifier with either a second positive or\n   hidden benefit.\n\nNote: When a specialization policy has been unlocked its preceding standard variant is forever disabled as an option."

 vef_encyclopedia.201.t: "Government Values"
 vef_encyclopedia.201.d: "Rule of Law, measured from 0 to 100, indicates the extent to which your ruler(s) are considered to be bound by something other than their own will.  Sources of this law could be religious, customary, or legal in the form of a constitution.  Rule of Law is affected by the path you take in certain events as well as certain policies and decisions.  The greater rule of law is, the more peaceful and prosperous society tends to be however it is also harder to make changes in your land (to government values, land ownership, and freedom) when they are protected by law.\n\n Privilege, measured from 0 to 100, indicates the extent to which certain classes in society enjoy special legal privileges above the common people.  These could be nobility, merchants, guild members, or others depending on the state.  Large land holdings for the nobility will naturally support their privilege, and over time the common people will become increasingly dissatisfied with such an arrangement.  Eroding the privileges of your powerful social classes too quickly will also result in unrest.\n\nFree Subjects is a quick reference value which tells you the average freedom across your provinces which are your core and either your culture or an accepted culture.  Each province is given a value of 1 for heavy serfdom, 2 for moderate serfdom, 3 for light serfdom and 4 for no serfdom.  This value is not applicable to republics as they only consider the freedoms of their electorate to be consequential."

 vef_encyclopedia.202.t: "Governance"
 vef_encyclopedia.202.d: "Governance is the ability of your government to control what goes on in it's provinces.  Without enough paid administrators to manage your realm you must resort to systems of feudalism or local autonomy to maintain order.\n\nGovernance is a factor of Administrative Technology and the Meritocracy(0-100) value determining how large of a realm your bureaucrats can manage.\n\nRequired Governance is the sum of all lands that require management by the central government including the whole amount of crown/state lands (lands not belonging to nobles, citizens, or the church) and a portion of all other lands relative to autonomy.\n\nWhen the central government is insufficient to manage the realm, Required Governance is greater than Current Governance, you will suffer penalties until the situation is rectified.  Autonomy will grow fastest in the most distant provinces and spread inward until a new equilibrium is reached."

 vef_encyclopedia.203.t: "Corruption & Merit"
 vef_encyclopedia.203.d: "All nations suffer a persistant §R+1§! yearly corruption growth but corruption decays at a faster rate the higher it has risen eventually reaching an equilibrium depending on a nation's modifiers.  Corruption is also raised whenever changes are made to active Realm Management modifiers or when land ownership and serfdom are being changed; other actions such as the spending of Papal Influence or speeding up subject integration can also affect corruption. Merit now grows naturally over time rising 1 point every five years to a limit imposed by corruption [100 - 2(corruption)]; a maximum possible merit level is also imposed at each yearly pulse [100-corruption].  Such that a nation with 30 corruption would see it's merit grow to 40 and be limited to a maximum possible of 70.  Merit may also be awarded through events/missions/decisions."

 vef_encyclopedia.204.t: "Liberty Buildings"
 vef_encyclopedia.204.d: "These special tracking buildings denote the legal conditions of the people that live within the province.  Slavery is used only in colonial provinces where the proportion of the slave population is a significant majority.  Serfdom of various levels indicates a feudal system at work which allows noble's holdings to be managed by them rather than the state bureaucracy.  Freedom is a lack of legal restrictions on peasant property and inheritance.  Civic Charters guarantee a city some level of autonomy from the central state as they are allowed to manage some of their own affairs.  Local Assemblies receive significant autonomy from the state as they elect their own representatives to enact their own laws.  Republic Cities indicate the electorate of most republics.  Some other special buildings exist for particular nations/governments which are covered in their nation-specific entries.\n\nThe most common way to affect the freedom of your people are the Serfdom options in realm management.  In addition, any time you conquer a province you will decide how to treat it's inhabitants.  Beware that large changes in the status of provinces will cause unrest and seizing land for the crown will strain your bureaucracy."

 vef_encyclopedia.205.t: "Land Ownership"
 vef_encyclopedia.205.d: "These special tracking buildings denote the ownership of land in a province; any land not covered by these buildings belongs to the crown/state.  \n\nNoble land is exempted from the need for bureaucratic management (required governance) so long as there is serfdom in a province; even after serfdom is abolished the nobility will continue to play a role in society so long as they own large swathes of land. \n\nChurch land belongs to the Catholic or Orthodox churches; it can be absorbed to or taxed by the state through certain decisions and events most notably by post-reformation faiths.\n\nGrand Priories are considered church lands which specifically belong to the Knights Hospitaller and always represent 20% of the province. \n\nCitizen land belongs to non-nobles and must be managed by the state bureaucracy to an extent depending on the province's autonomy."

 vef_encyclopedia.250.d: "The realm management decision allows you to set policies and adjustments for your nation on a by-area basis.  Decisions taken in one area affect only the provinces in that area, and a variety of modifiers are available regarding autonomy, serfdom, culture, taxation, and much more. Some policies are available on a regional or national level."

 vef_encyclopedia.401.t: "General Subject Types"
 vef_encyclopedia.401.d: "Subjects in VeF progress through a number of stages before they can be fully integrated into their overlord's realm.  Each stage of the process confers different bonuses and potential interaction options upon the overlord.  Any subject above 50% liberty desire will, as usual, be disloyal.  Ambitious or growing subjects can also revert to the previous stage of integration and eventually have the potential to rebel.\n\n\n  §RRebellious:§! A suzerainty which reaches 0% integration progress will be considered rebellious, receiving a 10 year boost to liberty desire\n\n  Suzerainty: A suzerainty is a newly acquired vassal which enjoys signficant autonomy. A suzerainty can conduct diplomacy with anyone who is not an enemy of their overlord and wage war against anyone not protected by them. They are not required to fight on behalf of their overlord who only recieves 25% of the regular vassal tribute.\n\n  Dependency: A dependency has become reliant on their overlord but still retains local autonomy.  A dependency may only conduct diplomacy amongnst other subjects of the overlord.  They will fight on behalf of their overlord who only recieves 50% of the regular vassal tribute.\n\n  Dominion: A dominion's political apparatus is reliant on the overlord in order to function.  Dominions conduct no foreign policy and they will fight on behalf of their overlord who recieves 75% of the regular vassal tribute.\n\n  Vassal: A vassal is considered an extension of the overlord's realm.  In addition to providing full tribute, only a vassal can be designated as a March of the overlord."

 vef_encyclopedia.404.t: "Special Subject Types"
 vef_encyclopedia.404.d: "Certain instances in VeF feature unique or limited-use subject types that do not integrate based on the general rules.\n\n\n Fealties:  Representing most of France's subjects at the start of the game, this subject type will not integrate and is allowed to conduct war and other diplomacy amongst themselves; France cannot be forced to release them in any peace accord.  Fealties will revert to the normal vassal system either when the Hundred Years War ends or if a fealty reaches 80% of France's military strength.\n\n Papal States:  The sovereign cities nominally subject to Papal rule, while happy to enjoy the Pope's protection, have no intention of submitting to his authority.  These subjects will not fight for independence but neither will they support the Pope in his wars nor pay him any form of tribute.  Only military action will bring these states to heel.\n\n Hejaz:  The Hejaz subject starts under the protection of the Mamluk sultunate or Ottoman Empire.  Hejaz will not fight in wars nor can it declare independence and it pays no tribute to it's overlord but does transfer trade power.  Hejaz is responsible only for the maintenance of the Muslim holy cities and surrounding lands; it will refuse to administer any other territories.  Hejaz can be released or transferred in a peace treaty; if released or if it's overlord weakens they may seek an independent path or a new overlord to protect them.\n\n Russian (Grand) Prince:  The Russian princes are the tribute states of the Kipchak Horde; one of them (the Grand Prince) is the Enforcer for the horde overseeing most of the other princes.  A prince who becomes large enough (either more provinces or a larger army than the enforcer) will be under the direct rulership of the horde and may challenge the Grand Prince for superiority. The Grand Prince can end the rulership of the Horde by defeating them (>60% warscore).\n\n Swiss Confederate:  The formal Switzerland tag (with the government of Swiss Confederation) can offer other Swiss states the opportunity to join their confederation if they have 200 relations and at least 90 trust. These subjects operate like vassals except that they do not go through the standard integration process, have a severely curtailed liberty desire, and can be annexed diplomatically with relative speed.\n\n Hanseatic Union:  A specialised personal union for the Hanseatic league where the member states share a ruler but cannot be integrated and pursue their own foreign policies."

 vef_encyclopedia.602.d: "Crusades can be called by the Pope beginning in 1309 and roughly every forty years thereafter until 1450.  One extra crusade can be called after that point if, and only if, both Jerusalem and Antioch crusader states have been liberated while Constantinople remains in Christian hands.  Crusades will target a major mediterranean city in Muslim hands and summon major Catholic nations to join them at their if they choose; the Knights Hospitaller will always join the crusade.  Crusades end when the target city is conquered or after twenty years."

 vef_encyclopedia.700.t: "Forts"
 vef_encyclopedia.700.d: "In various areas of the world castles and walled cities were the norm and support for these usually came from the local nobility or the city itself. In the early game, particularly as we start a century and a half earlier than vanilla, these fortresses were a significant check on expansion and were often difficult to overcome. Any given province in Europe would have at least one such structure (or several smaller ones) that would necessitate the time and investment of a formal siege. In the early 16th century, as cannon became more mobile and powerful, the situation shifted towards concentrated fortifications in strategic areas because of the enormous cost of building structures that could withstand such weapons. The early fortifications (Local Fortifications building) will start to disappear at Military Technolgy 28 as they fall into disrepair and aren't worth the investment considering their ineffectiveness.\n\nThese Local Fortifications have a chance of being destroyed when provinces are captured."

 vef_encyclopedia.820.t: "Development"
 vef_encyclopedia.820.d: "Adding development points to your provinces is now done through a passive system of hidden events which allow development to naturally build over time. Any modifier to Development Cost (except the modifier from province development itself) will affect the speed at which your provinces grow, as well as factors such as province size, land ownership, and stability. Manual development of base tax and production is still possible in provinces where the crown/state owns the majority of the land as well as in the capital.\n\nCurrent development growth progress can be viewed for each area by selecting it in the Realm Management events."

 vef_encyclopedia.830.d: "Culture conversion is not available via the standard pushbutton from vanilla.  Culture conversion happens slowly over time and without government interference often stagnates.  Using the Realm Management interface, your nation can affect the growth of your culture or accepted cultures in provinces you control and overcome the inertia of natural conversion.  The Promote National Culture and Encourage Accepted Culture actions are made 25% stronger by having a courthouse or town hall in the state."
