 vef_reformers.1.t: "Hussite Movement"
 vef_reformers.1.d: "In the early 15th century a movement for reform of the Roman Church was pushed by a Czech priest Jan Hus who advocated secular and administrative reform of the church while preserving its ecclesiastical and liturgical traditions.  His execution in 1415 sparked the Hussite Wars which ended with the Roman Church's acceptance of the Hussite moderates who were allowed freedom to practice in Bohemia. \n\nThe Utraquists were followers of Jan Hus whose only theological dispute was the reception of both parts of the Eucharist by the laity (the Roman practice being that only the priest received the wine) hence their name; Utraque being latin for 'both'. \n\nThe Taborists (in reference to Mount Tabor where Christ's return was expected) were radical Hussites following the teachings of John Wycliffe (instigator of the heretical Lollard movement) who opposed monasticism and instituted rigid application of 'biblical' laws.  They are seen as precursors to radical reformers such as Jean Calvin."
