 vef_jousting.1.t: "Jousting Tournament"
 vef_jousting.1.d: "A popular sport amongst the European nobility of the middle ages, jousting tournaments were frequently the attraction of spring and summer festivals for the royal court.  Although intended to be non-lethal, it was a nevertheless a dangerous sport which occasionally resulted in serious injuries or death."
 vef_jousting.1.opta: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] shall joust"
 vef_jousting.1.optb: "I shall watch the match"
 vef_jousting.1.optc: "Affairs of state require our attention"
 vef_jousting.2.t: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Enters the Lists"
 vef_jousting.2.d: "Sporting the finest armour and riding a magnificent charger, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] rides onto the field looking every part a knight of legend.  Whom shall he call forth as his opponent?"
 vef_jousting.2.opta: "Joust the Champion"
 vef_jousting.2.optb: "Joust a friend"
 vef_jousting.2.optc: "Joust a rival"
 vef_jousting.3.t: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Enters the Lists"
 vef_jousting.3.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]is not so young as he once was.  Although finely arrayed in his armour and royal trappings, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] looks out of place amongst a field of younger men.  Wiser men have suggested that he has simply dressed so for the pomp and ceremony; no man of his age should be foolishly jousting about."
 vef_jousting.3.opta: "Joust the Champion"
 vef_jousting.3.optb: "Joust a friend"
 vef_jousting.3.optc: "Joust a rival"
 vef_jousting.3.optd: "Withdraw"
 vef_jousting.4.t: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Enters the Lists"
 vef_jousting.4.d: "The court takes few pains to conceal their laughter as [Root.Monarch.GetName]rides onto the field.  His days of youth and vigour are long gone and many of the contestants are a third his age.  The court steward walks alongside the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], pleading with him to desist from such foolishness."
 vef_jousting.4.opta: "Joust the Champion"
 vef_jousting.4.optb: "Joust a friend"
 vef_jousting.4.optc: "Joust a rival"
 vef_jousting.4.optd: "Withdraw"
 vef_jousting.5.t: "Victory for the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]"
 vef_jousting.5.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetName]handily defeated his opponent with a display of superior horsemanship and accuracy."
 vef_jousting.5.opta: "Excellent"
 vef_jousting.6.t: "A Loss"
 vef_jousting.6.d: "Lesser men might have feared to give their all against their liege, but our opponent has jousted bravely and won the day."
 vef_jousting.6.opta: "Well struck!"
 vef_jousting.7.t: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] Unhorsed"
 vef_jousting.7.d: "A lucky blow? A loose saddle?  Whatever the cause, [Root.Monarch.GetName]was brought to the ground by his opponent sending shock and concern through the assembled court.  Brushing himself off as though nothing has happened, the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] smiles as he hands the reigns of his horse to his opponent."
 vef_jousting.7.opta: "A lucky blow"
 vef_jousting.8.t: "Tragedy Strikes!"
 vef_jousting.8.d: "The assembled nobles watched in horror as blood pooled around the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s helmet.  The surgeon shook his head gravely, and even as his grief-stricken opponent held $MONARCHNAME$'s head up he breathed his last.  [Root.Monarch.GetName]of $COUNTRY$ lies dead upon the jousting field."
 vef_jousting.8.opta: "A black day for $COUNTRY$"
 vef_jousting.9.t: "He Missed!"
 vef_jousting.9.d: "When the lord of the realm rode in the joust, it was often considered unseemly for his opponent to risk the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s person.  Our opponent's lance shifted at the last moment, not even grazing $MONARCHNAME$."
 vef_jousting.9.opta: "Most noble of him"
 vef_jousting.9.optb: "Again! A real effort this time."
 vef_jousting.10.t: "A Fair Pass"
 vef_jousting.10.d: "Most would expect a young knight facing an aged [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to reign in considering the disparity between them.  But with a mighty yell, your opponent spurs his horse towards you at breakneck speed."
 vef_jousting.10.opta: "I deserve no less"
 vef_jousting.11.t: "A Refusal"
 vef_jousting.11.d: "'With respect, my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], I cannot risk your person.  I must refuse.'  You can see in your opponent's eyes the conviction of his words.  You are no longer a young man, and it seems quite reasonable the realm cannot afford to lose you in so rash a manner."
 vef_jousting.11.opta: "Very well"
 vef_jousting.12.t: "Withdrawal"
 vef_jousting.12.d: "Having satisfied the propoganda of appearing on the field in all his glory, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName]withdraws to allow the younger men their sport.  Will you be remaining to watch the joust?"
 vef_jousting.12.opta: "Let us watch the tournament"
 vef_jousting.12.optb: "The government awaits"
 vef_jousting.13.t: "Jousting Outlawed"
 vef_jousting.13.d: "With the loss of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] himself upon the tournament field, our advisors are insistent that the sport of jousting must be banned lest we should lose more great leaders to senseless sport"
 vef_jousting.13.opta: "It is for the best"
 vef_jousting.100.t: "Tournament Day"
 vef_jousting.100.d: "The court is assembled and the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] has taken [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] seat amongst the spectators.  We await only the command of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] to begin!"
 vef_jousting.100.opta: "A fine day for sport"
 vef_jousting.101.t: "A Drink?"
 vef_jousting.101.d: "Like modern sporting events, the spectators at the jousts frequently imbibed significant quantities of wine and spirits to make the day's events more enjoyable. Would you care for a drink my [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]."
 vef_jousting.101.opta: "Certainly"
 vef_jousting.101.optb: "Better not"
 vef_jousting.102.t: "A Bit Too Much"
 vef_jousting.102.d: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle]s are not immune to the weaknesses of the flesh, and it seems [Root.Monarch.GetName]may have had a bit too much to drink."
 vef_jousting.102.opta: "Is a good day"
 vef_jousting.103.t: "A Wager?"
 vef_jousting.103.d: "Truth be told neither the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] nor his court are ever short of funds where their enjoyment is concerned."
 vef_jousting.103.opta: "Bet on the most prestigious knight"
 vef_jousting.103.optb: "Bet on the most experienced knight"
 vef_jousting.103.optc: "Take a chance on a young knight"
 vef_jousting.104.t: "Won The Bet"
 vef_jousting.104.d: "The [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s well-placed wager has yielded winnings.  Hopefully the nobles who lost won't be too difficult to collect from."
 vef_jousting.104.opta: "Haha!"
 vef_jousting.105.t: "Lost The Bet"
 vef_jousting.105.d: "Even when you are the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] lady luck sometimes just isn't on your side.  It's not as though you can't afford it."
 vef_jousting.105.opta: "Oh Well"
 vef_jousting.106.t: "$HEIR$ Asks To Joust"
 vef_jousting.106.d: "Your eldest son and heir seeks your permission to participate in the tournament; will you allow it?"
 vef_jousting.106.opta: "Very Well"
 vef_jousting.106.optb: "Certainly Not"
 vef_jousting.107.t: "$HEIR$ Rides!"
 vef_jousting.107.d: "With the reckless bravery of youth, $HEIR$ charges forward enthusiastically.  The opposing knight dares not risk the young prince, and allows him to break his lance in a grand flourish."
 vef_jousting.107.opta: "A fine display"
 vef_jousting.108.t: "$HEIR$ Sulking"
 vef_jousting.108.d: "$HEIR$ slouches in his seat on the royal dias, disinterested in the tournament and angry at not being allowed to participate.  His attitude wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the disgraceful scene being made in front of the entire court."
 vef_jousting.108.opta: "He'll understand someday"
 vef_jousting.109.t: "Defiance!"
 vef_jousting.109.d: "You turn from your pleasant conversation to see $HEIR$ ride into the lists.  Furious, but unwilling to make a scene in front of the entire court, you watch as he jousts.  He shows considerable skill and athleticism; you'd be impressed if he hadn't been so flagrantly disobedient."
 vef_jousting.109.opta: "The nerve!"
 vef_jousting.110.t: "$HEIR$ Enters The Lists"
 vef_jousting.110.d: "Decked out in resplendent armour and astride the finest of horses from the royal stables, $HEIR$ enters the tournament field to the cheers of the assembled court."
 vef_jousting.110.opta: "For the glory of $DYNASTY$"
 vef_jousting.111.t: "Heir Shows Prowess"
 vef_jousting.111.d: "Amid the shower of splinters from his shattered lance, $HEIR$ reaches the other end of the lists victorious.  Saluted by his defeated opponent, he waves to the cheers of the court."
 vef_jousting.111.opta: "Well struck my son!"
 vef_jousting.112.t: "Heir Shows Sportsmanship"
 vef_jousting.112.d: "Despite his skill, $HEIR$ still has much to learn and will not be victorious today.  He accepts his defeat with grace; saluting his opponent magnanimously and riding out of the lists."
 vef_jousting.112.opta: "An honourable showing"
 vef_jousting.113.t: "Heir Unsportsmanlike"
 vef_jousting.113.d: "$HEIR$ was soundly beaten, and in a fit of rage smashes his unbroken lance against the barrier.  Throwing off his helmet, he curses in the direction of his opponent and storms out of the lists."
 vef_jousting.113.opta: "For shame!"
 vef_jousting.114.t: "$HEIR$ Falls!"
 vef_jousting.114.d: "The heir falls from his horse, writhing upon the ground briefly before going limp.  Silence falls over the assembled court as the nearby servants rush to $HEIR$'s side and confirm the terrible truth: the heir is dead!"
 vef_jousting.114.opta: "It cannot be!"
 vef_jousting.115.t: "A Lady"
 vef_jousting.115.d: "Different nobles are always arriving at court, but this young lady draws the attention of everyone. "
 vef_jousting.115.opta: "Excuse me . . . "
 vef_jousting.115.optb: "It would be unwise"
 vef_jousting.116.t: "A Petition"
 vef_jousting.116.d: "No one particularly guards the tournament field.  As such, a commoner has mustered the courage to simply walk in amongst the assembled nobles.  Kneeling before the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], he presents a petition for consideration."
 vef_jousting.116.opta: "We'll review it later"
 vef_jousting.116.optb: "Throw this man in the dungeons"
 vef_jousting.117.t: "Daughter Asked For Favour"
 vef_jousting.117.d: "A young knight of the court rides over to the princess and lowers his lance.  With a coy smile, she ties a ribbon around it and blows a kiss in the knight's direction 'for luck'.  Perhaps it is your imagination, but you seem to sense something deeper is going on here."
 vef_jousting.117.opta: "Have someone keep an eye on this"
 vef_jousting.117.optb: "Nothing to worry about"
 vef_jousting.118.t: "Astounding Herald"
 vef_jousting.118.d: "His flourishing gesture and colourful speech captivate the court, singing the praises of a knight who must surely be the stuff of legend.  Then again, perhaps not, but this herald certainly knows how to spin a grand tale and enthrall his audience."
 vef_jousting.118.opta: "Hire him"
 vef_jousting.118.optb: "My deeds speak for themselves"
 vef_jousting.118.optc: "I already have a good man"
 vef_jousting.119.t: "A new champion of the joust"
 vef_jousting.119.d: "During the tournament, an unheralded commoner surprised all in attendance by besting everyone who faced him until he was declared the champion. Now we face the awkward decision of what to do with him."
 vef_jousting.119.opta: "The man must lead our armies!"
 vef_jousting.119.optb: "Tighten the rules to make sure this doesn't happen again!"
 vef_jousting.200.t: "Tournament Over"
 vef_jousting.200.d: "No matter how much enjoyment such festivities bring, we must always return to he business of state.  This tournament is over and we look forward to another day."
 vef_jousting.200.opta: "The day is done"
 vef_jousting.900.t: "The Last Jousting Tournament"
 vef_jousting.900.d: "We can feel it in the wind. Soon our equestrian elite will be nothing more than a dream remembered as the chivalrous tradition dies out before the onslaught of modernity. The world is changing, but for now, for one last time: Let the Knights of $COUNTRY$ ride!"
 vef_jousting.900.a: "Forward, to glory!"
 vef_jousting.900.b: "No, we need to get with the times"
