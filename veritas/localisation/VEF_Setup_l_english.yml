 vef_setup.3.t: "Merchant Republics"
 vef_setup.3.d: "As a republic of merchants, the merchant class expects the ruler to implement ideas that will benefit them.\n\n§RWARNING: If you do not take any of the base naval or trade idea groups (just one of them will do) before Administrative Technology 9 you will stop being a merchant republic!§!"
 vef_setup.3.opta: "I understand"
 vef_setup.4.t: "The Byzantine Empire"
 vef_setup.4.d: "The Byzantine Empire, also known as the Eastern Roman Empire, is a shadow of its former existence, holding only a few of its original possessions in the Balkans and Asia Minor. Its back to the wall, Byzantium is trapped between Bulgaria to the west and the aggressive Muslim armies to the east. The Empire is ruled by the Basileus, though its government is heavily influenced by its religious, military, and mercantile factions."
 vef_setup.4.opta: "We will regain our glory!"
 vef_setup.5.t: "The Osman Empire"
 vef_setup.5.d: "Osman I became ruler of the Sultanate of Rus in central Anatolia, creating the foundation for what would one day become the legendary Ottoman Empire."
 vef_setup.5.opta: "Our empire shall be mighty"
 vef_setup.6.t: "The Emirate of Granada"
 vef_setup.6.d: "The Emirate of Granada controls not only the remaining Islamic lands on the Iberian Peninsula, but a sizable portion of North Africa across the Strait of Gibraltar. With the Moroccans subjugated, Granada is poised to become the dominant power in the Maghreb, with one day, perhaps, reclaiming her ancestral lands to the north."
 vef_setup.6.opta: "Perhaps? Definitely!"
 vef_setup.7.t: "The Kingdom of Jerusalem"
 vef_setup.7.d: "Since aiding the Persians at Al-Qadisiyyah, Basil Phokas and his family have maintained good relations with the Persian Empire. For their actions, they were often viewed with suspicion by the Byzantine nobility. Belisarius Phokas would later commandeer his army, and with significant Persian support, defeat Al-Aziz at Damascus and again in northern Judea. Al-Aziz managed to hold the fortress at Karak, and Belisarius withdrew to consolidate his gains. On entering Jerusalem, he was crowned King of Jerusalem, Damascus, Tyre, and Sidon which, with their adjoining lands, were now gathered together as the Kingdom of Jerusalem."
 vef_setup.7.opta: "The greatest in the world!"
 vef_setup.8.t: "The Egyptian Empire"
 vef_setup.8.d: "The death of Saladin left the Mamelukes under the command of his son, Al-Afdal, who critically lacked his father's martial skills. Meanwhile, an Egyptian nobleman from Memphis styled himself Ptolemy I of the Second Era and rallied an army of defectors and militia to sack Cairo. Al-Afdal marched his army to Egypt only to find his garrisons expelled and the city gates shut against him. He foolishly laid siege to Memphis, but with the fields barren and no cities to support him, Al-Afdal was soon forced to leave Egypt."
 vef_setup.8.opta: "It was all part of the plan..."
 vef_setup.9.t: "Republica Fiorentina"
 vef_setup.9.d: "While Florence was nominally a noble republic during this period, the important positions of government were always controlled by the money of the powerful Medici banking family.  Despite the elections to the Signoria every two months, the head of the Medici family remained de-facto ruler of the city. \nTo represent this, Veritas et Fortitudo has introduced a new, unique government type.  The head of the Medici family rules the republic until death (like the Dutch Republic) and then appoints a new head for the family.  Often there will be several choices for his replacement.  The day-to-day operation of elections (and the rigging thereof) goes on behind the scenes while the holder of the true power remains unchanged.  In the event that the city's republican tradition falls low enough, the Medici may establish themselves as Archdukes of Florence just as they did historically."
 vef_setup.9.opta: "This will be interesting"
 vef_setup.10.t: "Kingdom of Sweden"
 vef_setup.10.d: "With enemies on all sides and within, and challenges in the Baltic, Sweden has a tough road ahead. \nCurrently the country is engaged in the Third Swedish Crusade, what started as trying to bring the Catholic religion to the Finnish and Karelian savages has grown into a full war with Novgorod. Although the Swedish armies managed to quickly capture large parts of Karelia a number of setbacks has occurred lately in the campaign, leading to an uncertain outcome of the war. \nIn addition, the king's two brothers are trying to wrest the kingdom from him, backed by considerable armies..."
 vef_setup.10.opta: "Well, what doesn't kill us will make us stronger!"
 vef_setup.11.t: "Duchy of Burgundy"
 vef_setup.11.d: "In 1309 Burgundy was a simple vassal of France, but with far greater ambitions.  The Duchy would eventually grow to encompass the Low Countries as well as much of eastern France, occupying Paris during the Hundred Years War.\n\nIndependence will come in time; Burgundy must be prepared to seize her opportunity and march onward to glory."
 vef_setup.11.opta: "Independence WILL come"
 vef_setup.12.t: "The Hanseatic League"
 vef_setup.12.d: "The Hanseatic League was a number of leading city states part of the Holy Roman Empire that ran a Baltic Trading League centered on the city states of Lübeck, Hamburg, Danzig and Bremen, and control the trade in wool, furs, grain and other vital goods around the Baltic Sea.\n\nThe four key city states vote for a new leader of the Hanseatic Trade League every 8 years. The country elected as a leader may perform a series of actions, including things as expelling rival nations from the league and pushing neighbouring countries into subservience.\n\nOffensive wars by started by members against other members results in their automatic expulsion, unless they are the current leader's ally, so be careful about who you ally, as they will have more or less free-rein to attack other members states should you become leader.\n\n§RIMPORTANT: Trying to leave the unions by declaring war on the leader country will only force you back into the union with a stability loss! Use the country decision if you really want to leave. This will however prevent you from forming the unified Hansa.§!"
 vef_setup.12.opta: "We are the masters of trade"
 vef_setup.13.t: "Russia"
 vef_setup.13.d: "Russia has significant resources, including both natural and human. A determined Tsar is the only way Russia can take her place amongst the great nations. The Tsar must struggle with the Zemsky Sobor (Noble Houses) to consolidate power and modernize the nation.\n\nIf you are starting as a Russian minor, factions and the power of the Tsar come into effect when you form Russia."
 vef_setup.13.opta: "We shall see..."
 vef_setup.14.t: "France"
 vef_setup.14.d: "France has a significant number of vassals that she must integrate into her realm if she is to be a world power.\n\n§RNOTE: Burgundy is too ambitious and will never accept annexation!§!"
 vef_setup.14.opta: "We will see about that..."
 vef_setup.15.t: "Yuan"
 vef_setup.15.d: "The Yuan is a Mongol Kingdom controlling large swathes of Chinese territory. The indigenous Han peoples chafe at Mongol rule."
 vef_setup.15.opta: "We will teach them to fear us"
 vef_setup.16.t: "Japan"
 vef_setup.16.d: "Japan is a collection of minor states waiting to be brought under a firm hand...\n\n§RNOTE: Japan is not playable in Veritas et Fortitudo. If you wish to play in Japan, you must do so as a daimyo.§!"
 vef_setup.16.opta: "IMPORTANT: Read the event text"
 vef_setup.17.t: "The State of the World"
 vef_setup.17.d: "The world of Veritas et Fortitudo is similar to that of the actual timeline, but some things are quite different. The Great Powers of actual history are not necessarily the great powers in this alternate timeline."
 vef_setup.17.opta: "But I will become one!"
 vef_setup.18.t: "Nomads"
 vef_setup.18.d: "Nomads live on the move and their administration is not suited to centralized governance; in order to shape a modern state they must construct a fitting capital and begin the process of building the institutions which can support their rule.  Nomads can move their capital at will (cost reimbursed on the five-year pulse) to select a suitable position from which to base their empire. \nBeware that a decision to abandon your nomadic way of life will not be without opposition from those who embrace it wholeheartedly."
 vef_setup.18.opta: "The world shall know fear ..."
 vef_setup.2000.t: "VeF and Random New World Maps"
 vef_setup.2000.d: "While VeF strives to support the Random New World option, there are several mechanics in the game that may produce odd results if you use it. Things that might be very odd:\n\n1. Vinland and Greenland will be \"out of position\" and their event sequences may not make much sense\n2. Norway may appear partially or entirely in the New World\n3. Discovery events that depend on finding North or South America may behave very oddly\n4. Events which depend on specific provinces in the New World may behave very oddly.\n\n None of these are necessarily game-breaking, just something to be aware of."
 vef_setup.2000.opta: "Got it!"
