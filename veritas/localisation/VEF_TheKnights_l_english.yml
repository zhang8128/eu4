 desc_kosj_fort1: "The Knights maintain a central fortress from which they plan and execute their foreign operations. These are impressive fortifications, with each section of fortification assigned to a grouping of Knights known as a Tongue. Each Tongue was responsible for one particular section of the walls, their own upkeep and maintenance, and a division of their regular duties. Tongue’s were organizational and political groupings based on region, culture, and language."

 successor_order: "Knightly Order"
 desc_successor_order: "Following the Reformation, several military orders were established in the tradition of the Knights of St. John, but adhering to the principles of the new faith and loyal to the national church rather than the Pope."
 theknights.1.t: "Suppression of the Templars"
 theknights.1.d: "Following the brutal suppression of the Knights Templar by Philip IV of France, the question of what to do with their landed possessions remained in dispute.  Anxious that the lands should remain in the hands of agents of the church and not fall prey to the monarchs of Europe, the Pope issued a bull in 1312 formally dissolving the Templar order and bestowing their lands upon the Knights of St. John.  This necessitated a large re-organization of the order based around seven 'tongues' arranged along Christendom's geographical and cultural borders."
 theknights.1.opta: "We shall use this wisely"
 theknights.2.t: "Knights Setup"
 theknights.2.d: "Hidden Event; please report a bug. §Rtheknights.2§!"
 theknights.2.opta: "OK"
 theknights.3.t: "The Knights Seek a New Home"
 theknights.3.d: "With the recent loss of their stronghold, the Knights of St John are without a home. The Pope has put the city of Rome at the Grand Master's disposal until they find a more adequate base of operations. The Knights have begun to evaluate their options. After reviewing several new bases in the Mediterranean, they have set their hopes upon $PROVINCENAME$. From this harbor, they plan to monitor and contest Muslim control of the Mediterranean.\n\nShall we sell the province of $PROVINCENAME$ to the Knights?"
 theknights.3.opta: "They may have $PROVINCENAME$."
 theknights.3.optb: "No, I like $PROVINCENAME$."
 theknights.4.t: "The Knights solidify control of $PROVINCENAME$"
 theknights.4.d: "The Knights have forced the allegiance of the region's local bureaucrats, sheriffs, jailors, and mayors.  Construction has progressed on a new citadel."

 theknights.5.t: "The Fall of Rhodes"
 theknights.5.d: "Our mighty fortress of Rhodes has fallen but our knights were conducted safe passage in exchange for surrender of it's citadel.  It is time to abandon Rhodes and find a new home."
 theknights.5.opta: "Very Well"
 theknights.100.t: "Fate of Grand Priory in [This.GetName]"
 theknights.100.d: "Our agents are uncertain of how to proceed.  Despite being a Catholic institution, the Order of St. John is respected far and wide.  Seizing their lands will inhibit their ability to combat Islam and draw the ire of the Catholic world."
 theknights.100.opta: "Establish a new holy order"
 theknights.100.optb: "They are just pirates; seize the land."
 theknights.100.optc: "Respect their property"
 theknights.101.t: "Closure of Grand Priories"
 theknights.101.d: "Given that we find ourselves at war with the Knights Hospitaller, it is naturally unwise to allow them to continue to draw revenues from our lands.  How shall we have these lands administered during this time?  It is expected of course that, as good Catholics, we will return the land when hostilities are through."

 theknights.200.d: "Hidden event; please report a bug."
 theknights.200.opta: "OK"
 theknights.201.t: "The Tongues"
 theknights.201.d: "The Knights were organized around the 'Tongues'; a grouping of Knights from a particular region of Europe.  Over time tongues were created or retired in order to keep the numbers between them roughly equivalent."
 kni_growing: "We have established a new Tongue, allowing for more efficient distribution of our forces.  As our priories and possessions in Europe grow, recruitment and support will continue to rise."
 kni_waning: "We have had to close a Tongue and reorganize our members; if our priories in Europe continue to be threatened our recruitment will suffer further."

 theknights.201.optb: "We Shall Recover"
 theknights.300.t: "A New Grandmaster"
