 vef_tradewars.10.t: "Lease of Chios"
 vef_tradewars.10.d: "Since 1304 the Zaccaria, a Genoese family, have held lordship of the island of Chios under a renewable lease from the Byzantine emperors.  In 1329, citing a dispute between two brothers over the inheritance, the Emperor dispatched a fleet to remove them and ordered the expulsion of the Genoese garrison (present since 1307). \n\nHistorically Genoa relinquished the island, but the Byzantines were financially unwilling to garrison it and the Genoese returned without incident a few decades later while the Byzantines were occupied with the Turks."

 vef_tradewars.11.t: "Maona di Chio"
 vef_tradewars.11.d: "Citing the weakness of the Byzantine Empire, a group of Genoese citizens has established a Maona (early form of a joint-stock company) with the aim of retaking the island of Chios and reestablishing the Genoese trade post and warehouses there. They doubt the Byzantines care much about the island and would not be averse to help combating Turkish pirates in the region. \n\nWe can allow this venture to go forward on it's own or the Republic may invest directly in order to better reap the benefits should the island be recovered."
 vef_tradewars.11.opta: "Approve the venture"
 vef_tradewars.11.optb: "Invest in the attempt"
 vef_tradewars.11.optc: "Forbid the action and dissolve the Maona"
 vef_tradewars.12.t: "Genoese Garrison Chios"
 vef_tradewars.12.d: "A Genoese fleet and small compliment of troops has landed on Chios and enforced the surrender of it's garrison; we have assurances from the Genoese ambassador that they have no further interest than to reestablish their secure trading post but can we trust them?"
 vef_tradewars.12.opta: "We have bigger concerns"
 vef_tradewars.12.optb: "To war"
