 vef_colonial.1.t: "Native Populations"
 vef_colonial.1.d: "Our explorers have reported native populations near our new settlement.  These natives are primitive, still living in tribes with only the most cursory forms of agriculture and stone or iron weapons and tools but they are numerous compared to our settlers.  How should our settlers respond?"
 vef_colonial.1.opta: "Use natives as a labour force"
 vef_colonial.1.optb: "Trade with the natives"
 vef_colonial.1.optc: "Displace them and take the land"
 tt_labour_natives: "We will conscript the natives to do forced labour, relieving us of the need for substantial numbers of colonists to exploit the resources of this new land.\n\n§YOur colonies will require fewer settlers and profit quickly but the majority of their inhabitants will be natives only partly assimilated to our culture; we will be able to displace tribal nations and most natives in a province will end up as subordinate persons in our colonies.§!"
 tt_trade_natives: "Maintain only a small trading post and acquire the region's natural resources through the native population.\n\n§YOur colonies will be small but profitable, settlements of our culture will be few and grow slowly but we will achieve large landholdings by native alliances; we will be able to offer protectorate status to tribal nations.§!"
 tt_displace_natives: "We will slowly push back the local inhabitants as the colony requires more land.\n\n§YOur colonies will grow faster and be strictly of our culture; we will be able to displace tribal nations but relatively few natives will be assimilated into our colonies.§!"

 vef_colonial.102.opta: "OK"
 vef_colonial.103.t: "Native Labour Faltering"
 vef_colonial.103.d: "The rigours of hard labour in the Caribbean combined with European diseases and brutal treatment by their overseers contributed in many cases to the near extinction of native populations.  As such, Europeans began the importation of African slaves to offset the losses and maintain the labour force."
 vef_colonial.103.opta: "Approve their efforts"
 vef_colonial.103.optb: "Forbid the importation of slaves"
 vef_colonial.104.t: "Importation of Slaves Into $PROVINCENAME$"
 vef_colonial.104.d: "The hard labour required to cultivate valuable plantation crops such as sugar and tobacco was unattractive to colonists from Europe and as such most colonies turned to slave labour to perform the task.  In the case of many island colonies of the Caribbean, this resulted in the vast majority of the population being made up of slaves."
 vef_colonial.104.opta: "Approve the importation"
 vef_colonial.104.optb: "Forbid it"
 vef_colonial.105.t: "Natives in $PROVINCENAME$ Disappear"
 vef_colonial.105.d: "It seems the vastness of the northern continent has allowed the natives to slip away and deprived us of our potential labour force."
 vef_colonial.105.opta: "Unfortunate"
 vef_colonial.110.t: "Lost Province Event"
 vef_colonial.110.d: "This is a hidden event. If you see this, please report error §Rvef_colonial.110§!"
 vef_colonial.110.opta: "OK"
 vef_slave_labour: "Slave Labour"
 vef_slave_labour_desc: "African slaves make up a portion of the population here and perform a disproportionate amount of the labour required to extract the local resources."
