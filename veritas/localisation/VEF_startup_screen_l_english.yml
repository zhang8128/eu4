 string_england_1309:0 "Edward I was a powerful king, recognised as lord of all the British Isles. Edward II is far less than the full measure of his father.  The weakness of Edward has emboldened the rebellion in Scotland and defeat is now almost certain while England's influence in Ireland has become minimal.\n\nEngland's relationship with France is tenuous at best; Edward II payed homage to the French crown for his possessions in Aquitaine but England resents the implication of her inferiority. A stronger king may decide it is time to reconsider the nature of their relationship."
 string_castile_1309:0 "The Reconquista resulted in a number of disparate kingdoms in Iberia but the the majority of them have been united under the Crown of Castile. That union remains incomplete as powerful lords reign in the south, particularly the Seignury of Villena near Toledo whose disputes with the crown are many.\n\nThe Emirate of Granada, the last outpost of Islam in Iberia, remains in the south both heavily fortified and rich; willing to pay substantial tribute to the crown in order to remain that way."
 war_scottish_independence:0 "Since 1296 the Scottish people have struggled for independence against the superior might of England.  To the Scot's advantage is the difficulty of subduing the hilly and decentralised country far from the centres of English power.\nThe English, on the other side, possess significantly superior resources and a chance to overwhelm the Scots if their leadership were not so poor."
