 chinese_artillery_0_1: "Hou Tong"
 chinese_artillery_0_1DESCR: "The simplest form of early artillery. Projectiles used in these weapons were varied, with many utilizing a variety of different ammunition, including rocks, iron balls or arrows. The weapons could pierce heavy plate as well as act as a terror weapon to troops and horses that had never seen the weapon before. Being low on accuracy, they were preferred as skirmish weapons which the bearers would maneuver as individual or in small group so that they could discharge their deadly guns at the enemy's flanks at close to point blank range."
 chinese_artillery_8_1: "Bai Zu Lian Zhu Pao"
 chinese_artillery_8_1DESCR: "The 'multiple bullets magazine erupters' , consisted of a tube of bronze or cast iron that was filled with about 100 lead balls, The Chinese explosive weaponry from the Late Song dynasty replaced the perishable bamboo of earlier eras with hollow tubes of bronze or cast iron, The weapon was extremely powerful and using a specialised eruptor, could send dozens of iron balls with half a pound of gunpowder inside to the enemy in a very short time."
 chinese_artillery_15_1: "Shenhou Fei Ya"
 chinese_artillery_15_1DESCR: "The Shenhuo Fei Ya (or Flying Crow) had four rockets mounted beneath its two wings, two to a side, for lift and it probably could fly like a simple rocket-powered glider. The wings of the bomb, in imitation of those of birds would have acted as stabilising fins on modern rockets, helping to stablise the flight and allowing them to fly straighter, stay aloft longer and go further. The core of the bomb was an explosive sphere with an elongated shape, and it would detonate while over the enemy's encampment with a brilliant flash, igniting fires."

They were ideal for dealing with enemies trying to scale city walls, or for holding the enemy at bay behind a breached gate."

When those same warrior families revolted once again in the face of increasing Imperial restrictions, leading to a period of nearly sixty years in which warfare was no longer between individual samurai clan and instead was waged between two opposing factions who claimed at least nominal authority over the entire archipelago. This new style of warfare necessitated changes in both tactics and equipment as infantry, even samurai, abandoned individual dueling, shed the bulky, heavy armor still used by the cavalry, and adopted spears in favor of the unwieldy glaive that had been favored in earlier times."

A question of succession ended up in a war between the two largest, most powerful samurai clans in the country. The nominal military dictator of Japan was helpless to intervene as armies on a scale not seen since the Mongol invasions ravaged the country and laid waste to the capital of Kyoto. With most of the fighting in the war centered on urban combat in the streets and mansions of Kyoto, close quarters combat forcibly took center stage away from archery for the first time in Japanese warfare. As the armies fighting ballooned in size beyond the scope of the traditional system of vassalage, men known as ashigaru, footmen whose only payment was the loot they collected from the battlefield, first began to appear."

 niitaka_infantry_21_1DESCR: "After the complete collapse of central authority following the Onin War led to the so called Warring States Period, or Sengoku-jidai, military conflicts increasingly took place on a local scale. Small time samurai who doubled as farmers on the side would band together to oust Shogunal officials, often under the leadership of deputies who had actually managed estates in the name of distant landlords. This led to the rise of daimyo, or great lords, who often ruled their fiefs as independent domains while paying, at best, only lip service to the Ashikaga Shoguns in Kyoto. As this process repeated itself time and time again across the country, ashigaru came to play a larger and larger role in the armies of the time. The term had now broadened to include not only glorified looters but paid volunteers and, more often, conscripted peasants. These ashigaru even began to intrude upon roles traditionally reserved for samurai, and masses of poorly trained archers unleashing clouds of arrows slowly began to replace small groups of elite samurai acting as sharpshooters."

 niitaka_infantry_25_1: "Oda Ashigaru"
 niitaka_infantry_25_1DESCR: "The Japanese Warring States period produced a vast array of startling changes, none more immediately apparent than in the way warfare was conducted. While groups of samurai would still act as elite shock troops in battle, they were increasingly more likely to command groups of ashigaru, now more disciplined soldier than unruly looter, who were coming to do the bulk of the fighting. This was epitomized in the figure of Oda Nobunaga, who fielded mass formations of footmen wielding very long spears, almost pikes, in tandem with blocks of archers and men wielding matchlock arquebuses introduced by the Portuguese in 1543. Nobunaga in particular was famed for his use of firearms on the battlefield, taking maximum advantage of how much easier it was to train a peasant as an arquebusier than an archer. According to some sources he even pioneered the use of rotating volley fire among his troops, ensuring a constant hail of bullets would greet any impertinent cavalry charge even before they reached the bristling wall of spears."

 niitaka_infantry_28_1DESCR: "By the end of the Sengoku period armies in Japan had come a long way from the loosely organized warrior bands built around individual loyalty that had started the conflict. The distinction between conscript soldier and samurai was no more. After the Sword Hunt of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, Oda Nobunaga’s successor and ironically of peasant stock himself, commoners were officially banned from bearing arms, and the ashigaru were inducted into the lowest ranks of the samurai. By dint of long experience and battle-tested tactics focused around mass formations and firearms these samurai forces, by now almost a professional standing army, were able to make significant gains against combined Korean and Chinese forces during Hideyoshi’s two ill-conceived invasions of Korea. The culmination of this experience was the battle of Sekigahara which saw armies numbering nearly a hundred thousand men each clash, and paved the way for Ieyasu Tokugawa to well and truly put an end to the incessant warfare and establish the long-lasting Tokugawa Shogunate."

While still the only people in Japan allowed to bear arms, with few exceptions the samurai were now more familiar with Confucius than Sun Tzu. In cases of marital strife firearms were were generally relegated to supporting roles at best, as the matchlock weapons were less useful in small groups compared to swords than they had been in mass formation. Firearms remained in production but were seen more as tools than weapons. The government even allowed  peasants to apply for permission to use them to clear their farms of pests."

They were usually barred from holding office in the central government and were excluded from weighing in on Shogunal decisions, but their size and wealth relative to other daimyo afforded them much greater latitude than that enjoyed by more favoured vassals. Satsuma domain in particular, under the Shimazu family, even invaded and claimed the entire Ryūkyū Kingdom as a vassal state independent of the central government. These tozama domains were much more interested in the outside world than the Tokugawa, and domains like Satsuma and Choshu readily adopted Western rifles, formations, and training methods."

 niitaka_infantry_39_1DESCR: "The Bakamatsu era saw Japan finally interact with the world on a more formal basis than had been the case in the earlier Edo times. It also saw civil war between the Shogunate and a collection of daimyo loosely named the Imperialists. Both sides rushed to modernize their military arsenals, which by the early 19th century still relied on a hodge podge mixture of traditional Japanese weaponry and horribly outdated matchlock firearms. Both sides hired Western experts from Europe, most notably a military mission from France, to advise them on training, equipping, and leading modern forces. Modern rifles imported by the thousands from Europe and the United States replaced the three hundred year old matchlock, and bayonets took the place of spears. Perhaps more important than any changes in weaponry, mass conscription finally superseded the old feudal forms of recruitment. Samurai were at first able to find positions as officers and crack troops in this new army, but after nearly a thousand years of samurai dominance in Japan, the military class would later be abolished during the Meiji reforms."
