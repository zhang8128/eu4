 flavor_anv.10000.t: "The Angevin Union"
 flavor_anv.10000.d: "Today, a new nation was born in the Angevin Union, a French-English hybrid nation born of centuries of conflict between the two countries. However, all is not well. Our monarch, as a gesture of plurality, has invited the elite from both nations to his court. As a result, it would appear that three factions have emerged: the Crown Guard - those in favor of the union, the Assembly - a collection of English nationalists, and the Estates - a collection of French nationalists. The three look to be at odds, with mutual loathing between each political faction. Such conflict is not sustainable, as both nationalist factions seek to sabotage one another at the expense of this great, albeit early, nation. The only faction that seeks a fair, prosperous state are the Angevins, who look to appease both sides. While our present monarch obviously favors the Angevins, only time will tell as to which factions future leaders will draw upon to man the court, and whether the Angevin Union shall last to see greater eras, or crumble beneath incessant turmoil."
 flavor_anv.10000.opta: "Longue Vie à l'Union Angevin!"
 flavor_anv.10001.t: "Bureaucratic Appointments"
 flavor_anv.10001.d: "The time has come for making appointments in the bureaucracy. Whilst the presented candidates are all of relatively similar competence, a number of offers from members of the various factions have come forward that seem very persuasive."
 flavor_anv.10001.opta: "Pay off both sides."
 flavor_anv.10001.optb: "British gold can never be beat."
 flavor_anv.10001.optc: "The French make an offer we cannot refuse."
 flavor_anv.10002.t: "Crisis at Court"
 flavor_anv.10002.d: "The Assembly and the Estates are always at odds. Recently, however, they have become more belligerent towards each other and it would now seem they have created a situation where the government is forced to intervene. With whom do we side?"
 flavor_anv.10002.opta: "The Assembly."
 flavor_anv.10002.optb: "The Estates."
 flavor_anv.10003.t: "Local Elite Dissent"
 flavor_anv.10003.d: "Community leaders in some of our provinces have become rather partisan lately, and the two sides have become increasingly at odds. Now, after a particularly spiteful exchange of letters on the topic of Britishism, the two are fielding their own militias. What should we do?"
 flavor_anv.10003.opta: "The government that governs least governs best, right?"
 flavor_anv.10003.optb: "The Assembly isn't that bad."
 flavor_anv.10003.optc: "I'm a big fan of the Estates myself."
 flavor_anv.10004.t: "British Naval Blockade"
 flavor_anv.10004.d: "In a spectacular stunt, several allegedly Islesmen-aligned naval officers seized control of several ships, and blockaded a nearby town that was rumoured to be under the control of a French guild. The blockade was broken shortly after, but now the townsfolk are demanding retribution."
 flavor_anv.10004.opta: "Execute the officers on grounds of treason."
 flavor_anv.10004.optb: "They were clearly intoxicated."
 flavor_anv.10005.t: "Estates Siege Township"
 flavor_anv.10005.d: "Yesterday, a number of well-armed Estates men lay siege to the city hall in one of our provinces. After burning a number of English flags, drinking several bottles of wine, and consuming a wheel of cheese, they were subdued by the city guard. What shall we do with them?"
 flavor_anv.10005.opta: "Execute them."
 flavor_anv.10005.optb: "Just a bit of harmless fun."
 flavor_anv.10006.t: "Angevin Agitators"
 flavor_anv.10006.d: "Recently, a number of merchants and craftsmen organized a strike in one of our towns. Although this was explicitly illegal, apparently they were protesting partisan policies adopted by the local government towards English and French businesses. After a disastrous court trial, they have asked us in decide on the matter."
 flavor_anv.10006.opta: "They are in the right."
 flavor_anv.10006.optb: "They are criminals."
 flavor_anv.10007.t: "Assemblyman Assassinated"
 flavor_anv.10007.d: "In another display of violence between the two factions, a prominent British noble was recently assassinated by a hitman allegedly in the employ of the Estates. The British demand justice, but the French say we have no proof. What can we do?"
 flavor_anv.10007.opta: "Persecute the Frenchmen at court."
 flavor_anv.10007.optb: "Appoint additional Isles advisors."
 flavor_anv.10007.optc: "Do nothing."
 flavor_anv.10008.t: "Estatesman Assassinated"
 flavor_anv.10008.d: "Additional drama at court today, where the body of a French noble was found lying in a pool of it's own blood at the bottom of a particularly long set of stairs. The injuries are clearly from the fall, and French state that clearly he was pushed. What shall we do?"
 flavor_anv.10008.opta: "Humiliate the British at court."
 flavor_anv.10008.optb: "Some Frenchmen would do nicely on the council."
 flavor_anv.10008.optc: "That's a very good question."
 flavor_anv.10009.t: "The Last Straw"
 flavor_anv.10009.d: "The glass slips slowly at first. And then you lose your grip entirely. The blood is only now pooling around his body. You stand up, shaking slightly. He only wanted to help. Those bastards just can't get along. Nothing will sate their lust for power. They will stop at nothing. Jesus Christ, he's dead. He's dead. He's dead."
 flavor_anv.10009.opta: "You bastards! Die, ALL OF YOU!"
 flavor_anv.10009.optb: "I can't do this anymore.."
 flavor_anv.10010.t: "Estates Coup"
 flavor_anv.10010.d: "Your guards lie dead around you. The group's leader steps forward. Pointing his sword at your throat, he offers your life in exchange for your throne. Why don't you have better guards?"
 flavor_anv.10010.opta: "You know, that's a pretty good deal."
 flavor_anv.10010.optb: "Because I am my own guard."
 flavor_anv.10011.t: "Assembly Coup"
 flavor_anv.10011.d: "The last guard drops to his knees, dead. The nobleman steps forward, and pushes a crossbow into your chest. Your throne or your life?"
 flavor_anv.10011.opta: "Throne."
 flavor_anv.10011.optb: "Life."
 flavor_anv.10012.t: "Crown Coup"
 flavor_anv.10012.d: "Well, they did it. The bastard steps forward. Pointing his crossbow at your throat, he offers your life in exchange for the 'sanctity of the Union'. Why don't you have better guards?"
 flavor_anv.10012.opta: "Your life."
 flavor_anv.10012.optb: "My life."
 flavor_anv.10013.t: "Anglo-French culture collapses"
 flavor_anv.10013.d: "Without the presence of an actively Anglo-French government and bureaucracy, the homogeneity of Anglo-French culture in $PROVINCENAME$ has become unsustainable."
 flavor_anv.10013.opta: "A shame."
 flavor_anv.10014.t: "Capital Turns Anglo-French"
 flavor_anv.10014.d: "With the arrival of the government at $PROVINCENAME$ today, many of our new civil servants and court members have embraced Anglo-French culture."
 flavor_anv.10014.opta: "Excellent."
 flavor_anv.10015.t: "The Unfruits of our Labor"
 flavor_anv.10015.d: "Our $MONARCHTITLE$, $MONARCH$, is complaining of his inability to produce an 'adequate' heir. He claims it is because of a biblical curse, although others are not so sure. The Pope nevertheless refuses to annul his marriage, stating he has no grounds to do so."
 flavor_anv.10015.opta: "Unfortunate."
 flavor_anv.10016.t: "An Act of Heresy?"
 flavor_anv.10016.d: "$MONARCH$ continues to complain about $RULER_ADJ$ inability to produce a proper heir. His ever-present advisors have suggested a number of solutions. One of them, a known Assemblyman, suggested using imperial precedent to annul the marriage. The French at court are shocked and appalled at such a notion, and demand reprieve. This can only get worse."
 flavor_anv.10016.opta: "Oh dear."
 flavor_anv.10017.t: "An Act of Heresy, Part Deus"
 flavor_anv.10017.d: "Tensions have continued to escalate between the British and the French following the suggestion by $MONARCH$'s advisor, with the debate becoming less theological by the minute and more and more about the divisions between English and French society and culture. Violent clashes in $CAPITAL_CITY$ and other issues look set to spark something of a civil war. With the heir situation yet to be resolved, things are looking bad and $MONARCH$ is getting more desperate."
 flavor_anv.10017.opta: "This is bad."
 flavor_anv.10018.t: "The Feces Hits the Fan"
 flavor_anv.10018.d: "The time is now. The conflict has reached boiling point. We must choose a side. The British have the majority in parliament, and have already 'passed' the act. It is waiting for royal assent. The French has assembled an army of fanatics, lead by senior members of the clergy, to defend their faith. The British are also prepared, with several thousand Englishmen armed to the teeth to defend the 'democratic process'. What do we do?!"
 flavor_anv.10018.opta: "Pass the act!"
 flavor_anv.10018.optb: "Veto it!"
 flavor_anv.10018.optc: "Dissolve parliament!"
 flavor_anv.10019.t: "A Bad Idea"
 flavor_anv.10019.d: "Bastards! The four Assemblymen who drafted the Act escaped our raid on Parliament, and now many MPs are declaring our actions unconstitutional and are demanding the resignation of the $MONARCHTITLE$! This is clearly a bloody mess of an affair, and the $MONARCHTITLE$ has fled to the countryside to raise an army. Meanwhile, a number of MPs, among them a certain Oliver Cromwell, have declared a war upon his majesty, to crush the royals and reinstate the rights of Parliament, whatever those are. With whom does our allegiance lie?"
 flavor_anv.10019.opta: "The $MONARCHTITLE$, always."
 flavor_anv.10019.optb: "MP for Cambridge Oliver Cromwell."
 flavor_anv.10020.t: "The New Model Army"
 flavor_anv.10020.d: "A number of people in our camp have suggested an interesting reform- pass an act that denies anyone the ability to be both a government official and a military officer at the same time. They believe that this will help develop a sophisticated and professional officer corps which may well help us win the war. Thoughts?"
 flavor_anv.10020.opta: "By all means, implement it."
 flavor_anv.10020.optb: "We hardly need it."
 flavor_anv.10021.t: "The Rebellion in England"
 flavor_anv.10021.d: "Blast! The Union is coming unraveled like a thread. Nationalists in England have declared their intention to fight for independence, citing the tyranny and devastation the Union has brought to then. It's doubtless however that the leaders of the are susceptible to coin.. What shall we do?"
 flavor_anv.10021.opta: "Pay them off."
 flavor_anv.10021.optb: "Let them revolt."
 flavor_anv.10022.t: "The Rebellion in France"
 flavor_anv.10022.d: "Damn it! The situation is getting worse. French nationalists have formally stated they shall fight for their independence, after having witnessed the destruction the Union and this war has wrought upon them. It's likely however the movement shall fall apart if we deal with the leaders quickly enough. What shall we do?"
 flavor_anv.10022.opta: "Take them out."
 flavor_anv.10022.optb: "Destroy them later."
 flavor_anv.10023.t: "The Purge of Pride"
 flavor_anv.10023.d: "Sir! We've discovered a number of dissenters among our main council of administrators. Apparently they've been conspiring with the enemy and assisting them! What shall we do?"
 flavor_anv.10023.opta: "Kill them all."
 flavor_anv.10023.optb: "Pardon the blighters."
 flavor_anv.10024.t: "The End of the Angevin Civil War"
 flavor_anv.10024.d: "The end of the civil war in the Angevin Union has come with $MONARCHTITLE$ $MONARCH$ having crushed the enemy troops and firmly established $RULER_ADJ$ authority over the Union."
