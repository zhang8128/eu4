 early_industrial_revolution: "Early Industry"
 desc_early_industrial_revolution: "Our nation's policy of free markets and entrepreneurship is showing signs of fostering a new sort of production. Recent technological breakthroughs in electricity production and mechanization are beginning to permeate throughout the economy, with 'factories' popping up in urban areas, rumoured to be able to out-produce 200 artisans in a day, drawing peasantry from the fields and into the cities, to work there."
 booming_industrial_revolution: "Booming Industry"
 desc_booming_industrial_revolution: "It would appear the preliminary stages of industrialization are over. Huge amounts of capital are flowing in from all over the country, from aristocrats, merchants, the government and the peasantry. New factories are appearing all the time, pumping out more and more goods, outcompeting our old artisan class by tenfold, and raising the nation's economic output by unprecedented levels. This truly is an Industrial Revolution."
 established_industrial_revolution: "Established Industry"
 desc_established_industrial_revolution: "The bull-market of mechanized industry is showing signs of slowing down. Increasing competition, trade unions and the finalization of mechanization in most areas of the economy are hurting the potential for growth of industry. Nevertheless, the economy has benefitted tremendously from this endeavour, and it has no doubt changed the course of history forever."
 lack_of_workforce: "Workforce Drained"
 desc_lack_of_workforce: "The fields lie barren. The workshops empty. The markets are no longer bustling, but dwindling. Our military endeavours have conscripted the vast majority of the workforce, forcing existing employers to pay the remainder ghastly sums for their labour, and stifling new enterprise. The situation must be rectified, otherwise our economy shall implode and we will be forced to suffer the consequences."
 industry_beginning: "Initial Industrialization"
 desc_industry_beginning: "This province is currently undergoing radical changes in its production methods. Artisans are being phased out for workers, and the rural peasant population is dropping steeply."
 industry_booming: "Industry Booming"
 desc_industry_booming: "The most radical demographic effects of industrialization are over, and now the expansion of production facilities and the establishment of supply chains and new industry is occurring."
 industry_established: "Industry Established"
 desc_industry_established: "Supply chains have been established, and the changes to demographics have stabilized. It would appear that the revolution part of industrialization has ended in this province."

 agriculture_booming: "The Four-Field System"
 agriculture_established: "National Markets Spur Investment"
 desc_cotton_beginning: "Cotton was one of foundational pillars of the revolution in many countries. Many technologies contributed to its profitability and drew peasantry and artisans to the towns and cities."
 desc_cotton_booming: "With the demographic changes over, private investors are beginning to see the virtue of the cotton industry and the capital is piling up."
 desc_cotton_established: "The boom is over, and now the market has settled down. Production will likely fail to increase as it has for quite some time now."
 desc_cloth_beginning: "Textile manufacture was one of the 4 pillars of the industrial revolution. With the agricultural revolution over, peasants are flocking to the cities and some canny businessmen are seeing opportunities."
 desc_cloth_booming: "Increasing wages and cheaper goods are driving the demand for clothing and cloth sky high. Private investment has surpassed state subsidies and now cloth production is at record highs."
 desc_cloth_established: "Growth has stabilized. Increasing competition has tightening the market, and so goods production has stabilized."
 desc_copper_beginning: "Some of the first steam engine applications were in the mining industry, sifting ores. Infrastructure and supply chains are growing at a resounding pace here, driving growth."
 desc_copper_booming: "Increases in the usage of copper in various industrialized industries has spurred investment. Machinery, wiring and ship plating all make use of copper."
 desc_copper_established: "Copper mining has reached its zenith in this province. Existing equipment is no longer finding new and accessible veins, and as a result growth has slowed."
 desc_iron_beginning: "Iron played a vital role in the growth of industry, providing input goods required for the manufacture for steel, as well as materials for the construction of machinery. Native industries are flourishing in this province."
 desc_iron_booming: "Naturally, iron during the revolution was in very high demand. As prices rose, so too did private investment, and subsequently production. Pig iron production in particular rose in volume, as a middleman in steel production."
 desc_iron_established: "Prices have stabilized and the orders for new machinery have slowed. The iron industry in this province will likely see only small growth in the future."
 desc_silver_beginning: "As with other mining industries, silver benefitted from increased efficiency in production. Sifting, drilling and tunneling techniques all improved during the revolution."
 desc_silver_booming: "Silver, as a precious metal, naturally drew investment in its production during the revolution."
 desc_silver_established: "All industries have a limit to their potential for exponential growth. Silver's profit margins have lowered significantly, and investment has slowed as a result."
 desc_lead_beginning: "Lead found uses in many industries during the revolution, as an ingredient in fertilizer, a glass pane liner, and ballast in naval stores. Growth of these industries led to new expeditions into mining this non-ferrous metal."
 desc_lead_booming: "Lead experienced a trickle-down effect from many of its client industries during the revolution, receiving large investments as a key part of the supply chain."
 desc_lead_established: "With the slowing of growth in other sectors, lead production is being toned down and growth is slowing to a more reasonable pace."
 desc_silk_beginning: "Industrial silk production found its death in the Industrial Revolution. Increased focus on cotton made the formerly luxurious fabric somewhat obsolete."
 desc_silk_booming: "Despite its falling demand, silk production increased as part of the ubiquitous investment that occurred during the bull markets of the revolution."
 desc_silk_established: "Although many firms went bankrupt, silk production in the revolution did benefit from increased efficiency from new machinery and energy sources."
 desc_navalsupplies_beginning: "Throughput in the production of naval stores did not increase as dramatically as in other sectors, due in part to the fact that the jobs required far finer detail work than other manufacturing jobs."
 desc_navalsupplies_booming: "Despite otherwise artisan work, certain input goods, such as timber planking, was manufactured in higher quantities due to efficient logging and planking techniques used during the revolution."
 desc_navalsupplies_established: "Naval stores in the revolution were in high demand, but despite this supply was forced low by circumstances and production remained relatively linear in growth until later in the 19th century."
 desc_glassware_beginning: "Glassware was revolutionized by the innovations of the 19th century, and prices decreased dramatically, making panes a far cheaper building material than ever before in human history."
 desc_glassware_booming: "The cylinder process made mass-production of pane-glass possible, drastically increasing the value of and feasibility of its implementation in architecture. The Crystal Palace is one example of such design."
 desc_glassware_established: "The glassware industry benefitted well from the revolution. Brought into the common light, glass became a viable feature in every house and a common product in building design."
 desc_coal_beginning: "Coal was literally and figuratively the fuel of the industrial revolution. Initial technological innovations in the United Kingdom were often in the field of coal mining, spurred by increasing demand for coal-fired energy."
 desc_coal_booming: "Demand for coal soared during the revolution. Production increased also, in England solely it skyrocketed from 2.7 million tonnes per annum to 250 million by 1900."
 desc_coal_established: "Veins of coal became harder to find later in the revolution, especially in Britain where coal had been mined since Roman times and by the 19th century were already quite deep. As such, production stagnated prior to the discovery of more efficient mining tools and techniques."
 desc_wax_beginning: "Candles, whilst previously rather difficult to manufacture and use due to their construction and material, were made commonplace by the industrial revolution. Automated wicking, paraffin and candied wicks made candles a cheap and affordable commodity for all."
 desc_wax_booming: "The invention of paraffin in the 1830s made candles cheaper to manufacture, as slack wax, being a byproduct, was easier to acquire than animal fats."
 desc_wax_established: "Automated wicking made candles incredibly quick to manufacture. One industrialist created a machine capable of wicking over 1300 candles an hour, an incredibly feat of its time."
 desc_chinaware_beginning: "Porcelain was considered a luxury good before and after the revolution. its delicate composition meant that machinery was unsuited for manufacturing it. Despite this, as in all sectors of the economy, production of the good increased as farmers were drawn to cities and the labour pool increased."
 desc_chinaware_booming: "As more and more skilled artisans were put out of work by other factories, many of them moved to the cities to find jobs. Chinaware was one sector they moved to."
 desc_chinaware_established: "As alternatives for many other products became more freely available, chinaware became an item of status for many. Increased value meant increased demand, which subsequently spurred investment in its manufacture."
 desc_agriculture_beginning: "The Black Death laid waste to our society, but perhaps not all is lost. The destruction of the feudal system and the rise of the monied classes has led to a sort of agricultural revolution, as the middle class buys land and takes action to improve it for profit. Sharecropping, land enclosure and land reform have increased productivity many fold in our farms."
 desc_agriculture_booming: "The four-field system, utilizing fodder foods, is increasing the fertility of our soil. Fertilizer, using manure and wilted plant products, is doing the same. As a result, production is increasing."
 desc_agriculture_established: "The development of national markets has increased the incentive for farmers to increase productivity. New tools, as well as improved transport infrastructure and land reclamation is drastically increasing production of agricultural products in this province."
 deflation: "Deflation"
 desc_deflation: "We are experiencing deflation. Prices are decreasing, and as a result our present savings are increasing in value."
 inflation1: "Inflation"
 desc_inflation1: "We are experiencing inflation. Prices are increasing, and as a result our present savings are being eroded."
 vfn_debase_title: "Debase Currency"
 vfn_debase_desc: "Reduce the gold content of our coinage. This should increase our ability to mint, but decrease our credibility and increase inflation."
 vfn_rebase_title: "Rebase Currency"
 vfn_rebase_desc: "Increasing the gold content of our coinage will decrease our available money supply, but increase our prestige and decrease inflation."
 vfn_mint_title: "Mint Coinage"
 vfn_mint_desc: "Mint additional coinage at our present base. This will increase inflation slightly, but increase the money available to us."
 population_small: "Small Population"
 desc_population_small: "Post-population boom, this province has come out behind many of the rest. Despite this, there is some increase in production."
 population_medium: "Average Population"
 desc_population_medium: "After having left the Malthusian trap, this province has middled out at a reasonable level of population. Production has increased as a result."
 population_large: "Large Population"
 desc_population_large: "A large population in this province has been cultivated in this province by massive agricultural surpluses. It is certainly a haven of production and consumption."
 population_huge: "Huge Population"
 desc_population_huge: "This province dominates all others, with massive centres of production fuelled by a huge urban landscape, with many hundreds of thousands of residents. An administrative and economic centre, this province carries huge weight for any nation that owns it."
 enclosure_act: "The Enclosure Act"
 desc_enclosure_act: "The Enclosure Act forces the end to common rights to agricultural lands and instead appropriates said rights to private persons."
 deregulation_act: "The Deregulation Act"
 desc_deregulation_act: "The Deregulation Act prohibits unnecessary and bureaucratic restrictions on the practice of business, and bans most forms of government ownership."
 vfn_industrial.1.t: "The Steam Engine"
 vfn_industrial.1.d: "A man working at a university in one of our larger cities has discovered a fascinating way of efficiently converting coal into steam and subsequently into power. Whilst almost certainly a fad, the phenomenon is nevertheless drawing some attention from the school's faculty."
 vfn_industrial.1.a: "Say, don't you know a fellow down at the coal mine..?"
 vfn_industrial.2.t: "Coal!"
 vfn_industrial.2.d: "The rising demand for fossilized carbon has triggered a rush of new surveys all across the country for this black gold. A lucky team in $PROVINCE$ recently found a substantial deposit, and have already bought a mining license and lease from the owner of the property."
 vfn_industrial.2.a: "Wish them luck."
