One such chance has arrived recently, when an imperial advisor living on the soil of one of our neighbors admitted to an agent from [Root.GetName] that he would consider moving across the border and support us at court for a price. While this may be tempting, there may be a greater price to pay if we take advantage of this: the wrath of the country he deserts."

The [From.GetAdjective] agents who bribed him to betray us probably thought we would not notice their hand in the matter, but they were wrong.

Having an imperial advisor in our service would certainly lend us credibility with the Emperor and strengthen the sentiment that [Root.GetName] is a loyal daimyo first and foremost."

Unfortunately, his suggestions of centralizing power are not possible without removing some authority from the retainers, who have begun to see him as an opportunist. At this point, trying to remove him from office over this dispute would probably mean we lost his loyalty altogether, but the retainers who stand to lose from his plans consider this a sacrifice easily worth making."
