 vef_forts.1.d: "As field artillery became more accurate, powerful, and mobile the simple defensive structures of the middle ages ceased to be sufficient protection.  Only those fortifications specially crafted, at great expense, to withstand artillery were worth maintaining and older structures gave way to ruin or were torn down outright as cities outgrew them. \n\n Our Local Fortifications are becoming obsolete; only those which we ourselves maintain will remain."
