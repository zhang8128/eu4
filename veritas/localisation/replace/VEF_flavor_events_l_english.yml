 java.e.1: "The Founding of Malacca"
 java.d.1: "The Malay Annals relate that Parameswara was a fourteenth-century Palembang prince who, fleeing from a Japanese enemy, escaped to the island of Temasik (present-day Singapore) and quickly established himself as its king. Shortly afterward, however, Parameswara was driven out of Temasik by an invasion, and with a small band of followers set out along the west coast of the Malay peninsula in search of a new refuge. The refugees settled first at Muar, but they were quickly driven away by a vast and implacable horde of monitor lizards; the second spot chosen seemed equally inauspicious, as the fortress that the refugees began to build fell to ruins immediately. Parameswara moved on. Soon afterward, during a hunt near the mouth of a river called Bertam, he saw a white mouse-deer kick one of his hunting dogs. So impressed was he by the deer's defiant gesture that he decided immediately to build a city on the spot. He asked one of his servants the name of the tree under which he was standing and, being informed that the tree was called a Malaka, gave that name to the city."

 flavor_sik.1.t: "The Sikh Faith"
 flavor_sik.1.d: "[Root.GetName] is situated on the border between adherents of Hinduism and Islam. In this area marked by religious tension and differences, a man named Nanak has started to preach that there is no Hindu or Muslim, but that the truth is with God, who is neither.\n\nAlthough his rejection of ancient customs has outraged devoted [Root.Religion.GetName] believers, Nanak's disregard for caste and creed has allowed his teachings to take root among the population. His disciples are known as Sikhs and are spreading this new faith rapidly throughout [Root.GetName]."
 flavor_sik.1.a: "We'll need to talk to this Nanak about the [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName] faith."
 flavor_sik.2.t: "Guru Angad"
 flavor_sik.2.d: "'Death would not be called bad, O people, if one knew how to truly die.'\n\nThe founder of our faith has passed away. Guru Nanak's body is dead, but the spirit of the Guru lives on in his successor, Guru Angad. Angad was one of Nanak's most loyal followers and carries on his legacy in establishing the Sikh community, spreading the use of a new alphabet to promote education of the young."
 flavor_sik.2.a: "The light of the Guru shines on."
 flavor_sik.3.t: "Guru Amar Das"
 flavor_sik.3.d: "Guru Angad has passed on and left the guruship in the care of his loyal servant Amar Das. A man of great humility, Guru Amar Das nevertheless has ambitions for the teachings of Sikhism, strengthening the doctrine of equality that has gained popularity among the common people and establishing religious representatives called the Masand, spreading the word of our faith further than the Guru alone ever could."
 flavor_sik.3.a: "Our Guru is the strength of the weak and the emancipation of the slave!"
 flavor_sik.4.t: "Guru Ram Das"
 flavor_sik.4.d: "Guru Amar Das has left this world and passed the guruship to his disciple and son-in-law Jetha, now known as Ram Das. He will oversee the continued construction of our holy city and encourages followers to attain enlightenment not only through solitary meditation, but from actively engaging with the community and their fellow Sikhs."
 flavor_sik.4.a: "Our Guru is a servant of God and we serve our Guru."
 flavor_sik.5.t: "Guru Arjan"
 flavor_sik.5.d: "After the death of Amar Das, his younger son Arjan has been chosen as the next Guru, despite contention from his older brother. To preserve the knowledge and hymns of past gurus, Arjan has begun to compile a volume known as the Adi Granth. The spiritual writing collected within come from many great teachers and the Guru has instructed that anyone may partake of it. He has also founded a great temple, the Harmandir Sahib, giving all Sikhs a place to meet and worship."
 flavor_sik.5.a: "We shall keep the knowledge safe and build upon it."
 flavor_sik.6.t: "Guru Hargobind"
 flavor_sik.6.d: "'As I crush these onions you have brought to me, so shall your son crush the heads of his enemies, and be at once a great warrior and exalted Guru.'\n\nSo spoke seer Baba Buddha of Arjan's successor, Guru Hargobind. The world has changed and the Sikhs can no longer trust their potential enemies to be merciful, but have taken up arms against those who seek to make martyrs out of the Guru and his disciples."
 flavor_sik.6.a: "Swords shall replace the crown of the Guru."
 flavor_sik.7.t: "Guru Har Rai"
 flavor_sik.7.d: "Guru Hargobind's grandson, Har Rai, has been trained by his grandfather in preparation for taking over the guruship, and now that time has come. Although instructed in the ways of combat and maintaining the army built by his predecessor, Har Rai is of a more sensitive disposition and his love for all living things compels him to seek diplomatic solutions."
 flavor_sik.7.a: "Enough of battle; now is the time for healing."
 flavor_sik.8.t: "Guru Har Krishan"
 flavor_sik.8.d: "The body of Guru Har Rai passed on, leaving a very young successor to assume the mantle. Har Krishan was deemed a better candidate than his older brother, who put diplomatic pragmatism before adherence to the faith. While our new Guru does not lack piety or kindness, his young age of only 4 years limits our diplomatic options."
 flavor_sik.8.a: "Our Guru is still our blessing."
 flavor_sik.9.t: "Guru Tegh Bahadur"
 flavor_sik.9.d: "The young Guru Har Krishan has tragically passed away. After some confusion about who his successor might be, Tegh Bahadur has been chosen as the new Guru. Initially a reclusive man, he has risen to the occasion and proven to be a determined leader. Despite his own rejection of rituals and ceremonial practices, he has taken on the task of safeguarding not only the religion of his own followers, but of Hindus who flee to our lands from persecution."
 flavor_sik.9.a: "Our Guru is the True King and the shield of the oppressed."
 flavor_sik.10.t: "Guru Gobind Singh"
 flavor_sik.10.d: "With the death of Tegh Bahadur, Sikhs have once again had to face hostility from their political and religious enemies. His son, Gobind Rai, is determined to unite the Sikhs and gather those who are willing to give their lives for their Guru. The coming decades will build up to the creation of the Khalsa, those initiated by the Guru's ceremonies into our faith, and Gobind Rai will be known to history as Guru Gobind Singh."
 flavor_sik.10.a: "The Khalsa belong to God, Victory belongs to God!"
 flavor_sik.11.t: "Guru Granth Sahib"
 flavor_sik.11.d: "Guru Gobind Singh is gone, but has passed on the guruship to one who shall never die. The collection of sacred texts known as the Adi Granth, once created by Guru Arjan and built upon by gurus after him, was designated by Gobind Singh as the final successor who will guide the Sikhs: The Guru Granth Sahib. Henceforth, whatever questions Sikhs may have for the Guru shall be answered by the knowledge contained within it."
 flavor_sik.11.a: "Those who want to meet God can find Him in its hymns."
 flavor_sik.12.t: "No More Gurus"
 flavor_sik.12.d: "[Root.GetName] is now a [Root.Religion.GetName] state. We no longer call ourselves Sikhs, and have accordingly cut off ties with the Sikh Guru."

 flavor_sik.13.t: "Nanak in [Root.GetName]"
 flavor_sik.13.d: "A man who some call a guru has arrived in [Root.GetName]. He claims to have received a revelation, being called by Heaven to travel from his home to distant lands, spreading the message of the one true God.\n\nHis local disciples insist that this God is revealed through all religions, including [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName], and defends Nanak as simply revealing the truths in our own faith. However, there is no question that these teachings reject our rituals and traditions, making people stray from the true path of [Root.Owner.Religion.GetName]."
