 desc_animals:0 "The presence of animals capable of being used for agricultural labour not only increases crop yeilds and the population supportable by the land but also reduces the demands of agriculture upon the workforce allowing more specialists, tradesmen, and urban dwellers to be supported by a society's farmers.\nThe additional usefullness of domestic animals that supply meat, milk, and eggs broadens the food supply and exposes the population to disease which, while sometimes fatal on a large scale, hardens the population in the long term particulary in comparison to those who have not been exposed and have developed no immunity to such diseases."
 desc_gunpowder:0 "While the existence, volatility, and potential uses of gunpowder have previously been known, only in the 14th century did the frequent use of cannon and other gunpowder-based weapons become a commonality on battlefields in Europe thanks to their spread by the Mongols from China (whose use of gunpowder anti-personnel weapons dates back many more centuries)."
 desc_scientific_rev:0 "Copernicus' assertion of the heliocentric model marked the birth of a movement based on observation and empiricism that would cause a blossoming of scientific advance in the years to come.  Although sometimes opposed by the church establishments in the west, the pace of scientific discovery and invention entered a new era of technological progress that could not be stopped."
 desc_agricultural_rev:0 "The great technological leaps made in the field of agriculture in the 17th century allowed populations to soar in the following centuries allowing previously unfathomed population densities to be supported."
 desc_nationalism_inst:0 "The growth of national identity, sometimes aligned and sometimes distinct from cultural affinity, gave rise not only to the patriotic fervour that sparked the American and French revolutions upon the ideals of the Enlightenment but also encouraged the long-simmering resistance in places like the Turkish-controlled Balkans."
 desc_chinese_bureaucracy:0 "The vigourous and taxing methodology by which China assured that only the best and brightest could enter her bureaucracy (let alone advance to high office) created a government whose efficiency was unparalleled in it's time.  The army of scribes that staffed the offices of the Emperor and his ministers allowed a flow of information that was not surpassed until Gutenburg's movable type revolutionised printing in Europe."

 institution_events.1.t:0 "The Renaissance!"
 institution_events.1.d:0 "Since the 14th century the wealthy and powerful in the Italian City states have been patronizing artists and scholars willing to explore the old Roman and Greek societies of their forefathers. As a cultural movement the Renaissance already encompasses most of the region and has had a profound impact on literature, art, philosophy and music. Humanist scholars are also analyzing the society in which they live, comparing it to the ideals of the classical philosophers. At the turn of $YEAR$ Renaissance humanism has grown into a more mature movement, ready to permeate all aspects of society. A new ideal for rulers as well as those who are ruled is spreading as quickly as the early printers can distribute copies of these new ideas. A true Renaissance humanist is an expert on everything from politics and philosophy to art, textual analysis, music and architecture. The Renaissance is now ready to reshape the world to better fit the classical ideals."

Iron mined and wrought in Scandinavia is being sold in West Africa by English Merchants and others are making a fortune just distributing cloth and spices within the South East Asian trade sphere. Local Indian merchants are investing in future European trade ventures. It may still be early to speak of a truly Global Economy but surely the first seeds have been sown."
