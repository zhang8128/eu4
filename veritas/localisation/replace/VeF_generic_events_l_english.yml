 ideagroups.1306.a: "Show them boys!"
 ideagroups.1310.t: "Back to the Front"
 ideagroups.1310.d: "A defeat is only a defeat if the army believes it is beaten. Our high quality armies view these events as temporary setbacks before the inevitable victory. Thus, not only are our soldiers always ready to return to the fight, but these days they are positively keen to do so!"
 ideagroups.1310.a: "This is good!"
 ideagroups.111.t: "Military Treatise"
 ideagroups.111.d: "Our emphasis on a strong aristocracy has given the nobility means to serve in the army. They are devoting more of their attention to the military. One has published a treatise on military thought."

 ideagroups.216.d: "Our farms are enjoying a boom in productivity. This in turn is giving a boost to all areas of our economy. This is good because there is more to tax."

 ideagroups.506.d: "When you have a diplomatic corps that is experienced with finding information, they find stuff internally as well. It seems our beloved $MONARCHTITLE$ has not been fulfilling his duties to his wife, and instead has been out seducing young noblewomen. And now, one of them is even with child."

 EVTNAME1009: "Mughal Empire"
 EVTDESC1009: "$MONARCH$ has begun to lay the foundation of his new empire. Although outnumbered, his well-disciplined troops have managed to achieve several decisive victories against the Sultans of India. The battle of $CAPITAL$ became the first great victory in a series of territorial expansions and, with time, the empire of the Mughals could stretch over the larger part of the Indian plateau."
 EVTOPTA1009: "Form the Indian Empire" 
 EVTNAME3093: "Unscrupulous In-laws"
 EVTDESC3093: "A State Marriage can sometimes be a blessing but in our weakened state, due to the clash between the monarch and the aristocracy, it is nothing less than a curse. Opportunistic in-laws are regarding this as the perfect timing to expand their influence and obtain more power."
 EVTOPTA3093: "Take appropriate measures"
 EVTOPTB3093: "Ignore their pathetic attempts"
 EVTNAME6113: "The Public Hates Conscription"
 EVTDESC6113: "Usually our system of national conscripts functions like a well oiled machine, but at the moment we are encountering some resistance to recruitment. You know, riots, recruiting parties being attacked, minor things like that."
 EVTOPTA6113: "Well, I'm sure this will just be in the short-term."
 EVTOPTB6113: "Bah! I need soldiers, not whiners"
 EVTNAME6117: "Military Complacency"
 EVTDESC6117: "Our superbly drilled army is, in the opinion of our most influential generals, invincible. Any recent defeats can be marked down to bad weather, or the enemy using unmanly things such as tactics. As far as our generals are concerned, there is no improving upon perfection."
 EVTOPTA6117: "\"Invincible.\" I like the sound of that."
 EVTOPTB6117: "I think this truth may upset some people..."
 EVTNAME6121: "Fortification Works"
 EVTDESC6121: "Our Engineers have enhanced a fortification, making it a substantial barrier to enemy forces."
 EVTOPTA6121: "Let's hope someone tries to siege it"
 EVTNAME6122: "Epic Fortification Constructed"
 EVTDESC6122: "An already substantial fortification has been enhanced by our engineers, even though some of our generals feel that our troops are wasted cowering behind closed walls."
 EVTOPTA6122: "One mustn't grumble"
 EVTNAME6123: "New Bastions Constructed"
 EVTDESC6123: "Just when it seemed that our fortifications couldn't get any better, one of our engineers came up with this great idea of a triangular bastion. Not only do they look great, they also seem to slow down the enemy."
 EVTOPTA6123: "I guess I shouldn't complain"
 EVTNAME6124: "A Fort Falls into Disrepair"
 EVTDESC6124: "A minor fortification has been neglected by our engineers, and has fallen into disrepair. To be honest, at the moment it probably wouldn't even delay a party of school children, nevermind an invading army."
 EVTOPTA6124: "Real men don't hide behind forts"
 EVTOPTB6124: "Perhaps some repairs are in order"
 EVTNAME6125: "Fort Decays"
 EVTDESC6125: "Our Engineers have sadly neglected the condition of this fortification. Unless immediate action is taken, this fort will only offer minimal protection."
 EVTOPTA6125: "It isn't important"
 EVTOPTB6125: "This isn't a problem funding can't solve!"
 EVTNAME6126: "Fort Crumbles"
 EVTDESC6126: "A recent audit has revealed that the walls of one of our fortifications are crumbling, while our engineering corps claims that there isn't enough money for repairs. If nothing is done, its protective ability will be reduced. However, on the long-term basis, it could serve as a major tourist attraction in a few hundred years time, boosting the local economy."
 EVTOPTA6126: "...Let's go for long-term gain"
 EVTOPTB6126: "What absurd thinking. A fort is a fort!"
 EVTNAME6127: "Fort Weakens"
 EVTDESC6127: "Poor maintenance work by our Engineer Corps has left one of our more substantial fortifications with crippling structural damage. For this fort to remain relevant, we must commence major repairs immediately."

 EVTOPTB6127: "No, we must repair such an important fort"
 EVTNAME6128: "Complacent Engineers"
 EVTDESC6128: "It has been discovered that one of our largest fortifications is no longer effective after a bout of complacency in our Engineer Corps."

 EVTOPTB6128: "Action must be taken!"
 EVTNAME6129: "Fortress in Crisis!"
 EVTDESC6129: "Substantial neglect by our Engineer Corps has left one of our most powerful and modern fortresses with a severely compromised wall. Any besieging army would be able to exploit this."
 EVTOPTA6129: "Our experts have spoken..."
 EVTOPTB6129: "No! We must do something immediately!"
 EVTNAME6130: "Promising General"
 EVTDESC6130: "Due to our upstanding policy of battlefield commissions, a new general has risen through the ranks."
 EVTOPTA6130: "He certainly shows promise"
 EVTNAME6131: "Nobility Concerned with Loss of Privileges"
 EVTDESC6131: "Our policy of battlefield commissions is seriously concerning our nobles. They believe that, just because a man shows some ability on the battlefield, doesn't mean that he will be a good general. In fact, it seems that life in the mess is becoming quite unbearable, as these new officers have no idea how a real gentleman behaves. There are also rumors that the rank and file believe that a good leader ought to be better bred."
 EVTOPTA6131: "Does nobility really matter?"
 EVTOPTB6131: "Well, I think making things a bit more difficult in the short term might be better."
 EVTNAME6132: "Glory of the Army"
 EVTDESC6132: "Our glorious army is enhancing the prestige of our nation."
 EVTOPTA6132: "Glory to us!"
 EVTNAME6133: "Our army has seen better days..."
 EVTDESC6133: "The tarnish seems to have come off the glory of our arms. People just don't see our army as prestigiously as they did before."
 EVTOPTA6133: "Time to shake things up then!"
 EVTOPTB6133: "I don't think there is much that can be done..."
 EVTNAME6134: "Our Merchants are Adventuring"
 EVTDESC6134: "Current trading conditions strongly favoring our merchants, and they're ready to take advantage of this."
 EVTOPTA6134: "Excellent."
 EVTNAME6135: "Our Merchants are Doing Poorly"
 EVTDESC6135: "Although our adventuring merchants were doing good business, things have recently taken a turn for the worse."
 EVTOPTA6135: "I guess we'll just have to tighten our belts"
 EVTOPTB6135: "A few unpopular reforms are the answer!"
 EVTNAME6312: "Our Army's Élan Makes Rivals Quake in Fear"
 EVTDESC6312: "Our decision to institute offensive policy over defensive has led to ferocious and frightening tales about the élan of armies. We should heartily breath life into these whispers!"

 EVTOPTA6426: "That is good news"
 EVTNAME6429: "Iron Ore Quality Problems"
 EVTDESC6429: "One of our iron ore mines has hit some diluted iron ore. This has made the raising of units more expensive."
 EVTOPTA6429: "I'm sure we have enough men anyway"
 EVTNAME872: "A Traveling Minstrel"
 EVTDESC872: "A renowned minstrel recently crossed our nation's borders. His intention is to roam our country, bringing joy to all those that hear him, but some say only your ears are fit to hear such wonderful music."
 EVTOPTA872: "Allow him to go where his heart desires."
 EVTOPTB872: "Bring him to court"
 EVTNAME873: "A Bountiful Harvest"
 EVTDESC873: "This year's harvest have been exceptional! Rarely in our nation's history has the earth brought forth so much of its bounty. The populace are already interpreting this as a sign that we are enjoying divine favor."
 EVTOPTA873: "We are blessed!"

 EVTDESC700: "The term is up for $MONARCH$. With enough support he can stay in office, but then he must defeat his three primary competitors..."

 EVTNAME9463: "The [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]s"
 EVTDESC9463: "...meanwhile, in another country, a different branch of the $DYNASTY$ family is in dire straits. With their country destabilized, they now struggle to cling on to power. If we do not help them now, their situation might worsen significantly. What is the best course of action?"
 EVTOPTA9463: "Family first, brother."
 EVTOPTB9463: "I already gave at the office, brother."
 EVTNAME9472: "Benign Neglect"
 EVTDESC9472: "It seems that the government that governs the least governs the best as far as $PROVINCENAME$ is concerned. Our non-involvement in $PROVINCENAME$ has proven beneficial, and the local economy is booming."
 EVTOPTA9472: "They can do things on their own...?"
 EVTOPTB9472: "If it moves, tax it"
 EVTNAME9476: "The [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName]s"

 EVTOPTA9477: "A house divided cannot stand"
 EVTNAME724: "Clergy Condemns a Popular Philosopher!"
 EVTDESC724: "A prominent natural philosopher is forwarding new claims that contradict religious truths. The clergy demands that his heretic thought be stopped, and he turned over for punishment. Either way, this will cause great turmoil in the realm."
 EVTOPTA724: "Support Clergy"
 EVTOPTB724: "Support Philosopher"
 EVTNAME816: "Losing Control"
 EVTDESC816: "With our new laws that tie the peasantry less firmly to the land, it seems that they are also getting strange new ideas about their precise role in the grand scheme of things."
 EVTOPTB816A: "This is a worrying development"
 EVTNAME734: "Demand for a Stable Government"
 EVTDESC734: "Several of the leading members of the government are deeply worried about some changes proposed to how the realm should be ruled. They demand a stop to such outrageous reforms, based on our tried and proved traditions (naturally, avoiding to mention how the changes would impact their own power base)."
 EVTOPTA734: "Accept the demands"
 EVTOPTB734: "Ignore them"
 EVTNAME737: "Local Fortification Expert Discovered"
 EVTDESC737: "It seems as if there is a great man in one of our provinces, and he has some rather intriguing ideas on how to better fortify our realm. However, he is reluctant to leave his hometown."
 EVTOPTA737: "Hire him! The entire country needs this man!"
 EVTOPTB737: "Draft him to fortify his local province"
 colonial_nation.EVTNAME114: "Tariffs on Timber"
 colonial_nation.EVTDESC114: "The timber production in one of our colonies has come into focus. It seems that it generates quite a lot of money. Perhaps too much without being properly taxed. In the spirit of mercantilism, we should force them to trade their timber through our ports instead. This will greatly benefit our own merchants and add a lot of income to the crown's coffers."
 colonial_nation.EVTDESC115: "Bad news from the Old World! [From.GetName] has tightened their grip on our economy by introducing a new tariff on Timber."
 colonial_nation.EVTOPTA115: "Perhaps we should throw the timber into the sea instead..."
 colonial_nation.EVTNAME154: "Smuggling of Timber."
 colonial_nation.EVTDESC154: "The tariffs on timber imposed on us by [Root.ColonialParent.GetName] are cutting deep into the profits of our merchants. They demand that we send a delegation to [Root.ColonialParent.Capital.GetCapitalName] to protest these taxes or they will turn to smuggling."
 colonial_nation.EVTDESC155: "Our tariffs on timber have caused great upheaval in the colonies. Outraged traders threaten with smuggling to avoid the taxes cutting too deep into their profits. We should demand that [From.Monarch.GetTitle] [From.Monarch.GetName] quickly puts an end to this nonsense."
 smuggling_of_naval_supplies: "Smuggling of Timber."

Things that might be very odd:\n\n1. Vinland and Greenland will be \"out of position\" and their event sequences may not make much sense\n2. Discovery events that depend on finding North or South America may behave very oddly\n3. Events which depend on specific provinces in the New World may behave very oddly.\n\n None of these are game-breaking, just something to be aware of."
